# Preview of **Figure 1**

## Summary 

The *Figure 1* presents 
an overview of the results for the harm on population health 
by each weather event type. 

It attempts to address the question:  

* Across the United States, which types of events 
(as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) 
are most harmful with respect to population health?

All details on the source data, the data processing procedure 
and other aspects of the analysis from which these results were obtained 
are available at the associated GitHub repository:

## Description  

The *Figure 2* consists of three parts, 
one for each of the three perspective examined:  

* **PART 1**  
  * Contains the *Multiplot 1.1* which 
  displays the results for the harm on population health 
  with respect to fatalities by each weather event type 
  for all the aspects that were examined. 
  It consists of four plots:  
    * Plot 1.1.1  
      * Displays the overall average number of fatalities 
      caused by each weather event type 
      based on all the cases of weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero fatalities.  
    * Plot 1.1.2  
      * Displays the average number of fatalities 
      caused by each weather event type 
      based on 90% of weather events with the lowest impact 
      (for each weather event type)
      that resulted in non-zero fatalities.  
    * Plot 1.1.3  
      * Displays the average number of fatalities 
      caused by each weather event type 
      based on 10% of weather events with the highest impact 
      (for each weather event type)
      that resulted in non-zero fatalities.  
    * Plot 1.1.4  
      * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
      of the average number of fatalities 
      for the 90% of its observations with the lowest impact 
      versus the average number of fatalities 
      for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
      based only on the weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero fatalities.  
* **PART 2**  
  * Contains the *Multiplot 1.2* which 
  displays the results for the harm on population health 
  with respect to injuries by each weather event type 
  for all the aspects that were examined. 
  It consists of four plots:  
    * Plot 1.2.1  
      * Displays the overall average number of injuries 
      caused by each weather event type based 
      on all the cases of weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
    * Plot 1.2.2  
      * Displays the average number of injuries 
      caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
      with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
    * Plot 1.2.3  
      * Displays the average number of injuries 
      caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
      with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
    * Create The Plot 1.2.4
      * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
      of the average number of injuries for the 90% of its observations 
      with the lowest impact versus the average number of injuries 
      for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
      based only on the weather events that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
* **PART 3**  
  * Contains the *Multiplot 1.3* which 
  displays the results for the harm on population health 
  with respect to casualties by each weather event type 
  for all the aspects that were examined. 
  It consists of four plots:  
    * Plot 1.3.1  
      * Displays the overall average number of casualties 
      caused by each weather event type based 
      on all the cases of weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero casualties.  
    * Plot 1.3.2  
      * Displays the average number of casualties 
      caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
      with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero casualties.  
    * Plot 1.3.3  
      * Displays the average number of casualties 
      caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
      with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero casualties.  
    * Plot 1.3.4
      * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
      of the average number of casualties for the 90% of its observations 
      with the lowest impact versus the average number of casualties 
      for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
      based only on the weather events that resulted in non-zero casualties.
