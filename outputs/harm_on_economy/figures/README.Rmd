# Preview of **Figure 2**

## Summary 

The *Figure 2* presents 
an overview of the results for the harm on economy 
by each weather event type. 

It attempts to address the question:  

* Across the United States, which types of events 
have the greatest economic consequences?  

All details on the source data, the data processing procedure 
and other aspects of the analysis from which these results were obtained 
are available at the associated GitHub repository:

## Description  

The *Figure 2* consists of three parts, 
one for each of the three perspective examined:  

* **PART 1**  
  * Contains the *Multiplot 2.1* which
  displays the results for the harm on economy 
  with respect to property damage by each weather event type 
  for all the aspects that were examined. 
  It consists of four plots:  
    * The Plot 2.1.1  
      * Displays the overall average property damage 
      caused by each weather event type based 
      on all the cases of weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero property damage.  
    * Plot 2.1.2  
      * Displays the average property damage 
      caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
      with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero property damage.  
    * Plot 2.1.3  
      * Displays the average property damage 
      caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
      with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero property damage.  
    * Plot 2.1.4  
      * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
      of the average property damage for the 90% of its observations 
      with the lowest impact versus the average property damage 
      for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
      based only on the weather events that resulted 
      in non-zero property damage.  
* **PART 2**  
  * Contains the *Multiplot 2.2* which 
  displays the results for the harm on economy 
  with respect to crop damage by each weather event type 
  for all the aspects that were examined.
  It consists of four plots:  
    * Plot 2.2.1  
      * Displays the overall average crop damage 
      caused by each weather event type based 
      on all the cases of weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero crop damage.  
    * Plot 2.2.2  
      * Displays the average crop damage 
      caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
      with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero crop damage.  
    * Plot 2.2.3  
       * Displays the average crop damage 
      caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
      with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero crop damage.  
    * Plot 2.2.4  
      * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
      of the average crop damage for the 90% of its observations 
      with the lowest impact versus the average crop damage 
      for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
      based only on the weather events that resulted 
      in non-zero crop damage.  
* **PART 3**  
  * Contains the *Multiplot 2.3* which 
  displays the results for the harm on economy 
  with respect to economic damage by each weather event type 
  for all the aspects that were examined. 
  It consists of four plots:  
    * Plot 2.3.1  
      * Displays the overall average economic damage 
      caused by each weather event type based 
      on all the cases of weather events 
      that resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
    * Plot 2.3.2  
      * Displays the average economic damage 
      caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
      with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
    * Plot 2.3.3  
      * Displays the average economic damage 
      caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
      with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
      that resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
    * The Plot 2.3.4  
      * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
      of the average economic damage for the 90% of its observations 
      with the lowest impact versus the average economic damage 
      for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
      based only on the weather events that resulted 
      in non-zero economic damage.
