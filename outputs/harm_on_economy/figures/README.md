Summary
-------

The *Figure 2* presents an overview of the results for the harm on
economy by each weather event type.

It attempts to address the question:

-   Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest
    economic consequences?

All details on the source data, the data processing procedure and other
aspects of the analysis from which these results were obtained are
available at the associated GitHub repository:

Description
-----------

The *Figure 2* consists of three parts, one for each of the three
perspective examined:

-   **PART 1**
    -   Contains the *Multiplot 2.1* which displays the results for the
        harm on economy with respect to property damage by each weather
        event type for all the aspects that were examined. It consists
        of four plots:
        -   The Plot 2.1.1
            -   Displays the overall average property damage caused by
                each weather event type based on all the cases of
                weather events that resulted in non-zero property
                damage.  
        -   Plot 2.1.2
            -   Displays the average property damage caused by each
                weather event type based on 90% of weather events with
                the lowest impact (for each weather event type) that
                resulted in non-zero property damage.  
        -   Plot 2.1.3
            -   Displays the average property damage caused by each
                weather event type based on 10% of weather events with
                the highest impact (for each weather event type) that
                resulted in non-zero property damage.  
        -   Plot 2.1.4
            -   Displays a comparison for each weather event type, of
                the average property damage for the 90% of its
                observations with the lowest impact versus the average
                property damage for the 10% of its observations with the
                highest impact based only on the weather events that
                resulted in non-zero property damage.  
-   **PART 2**
    -   Contains the *Multiplot 2.2* which displays the results for the
        harm on economy with respect to crop damage by each weather
        event type for all the aspects that were examined. It consists
        of four plots:
        -   Plot 2.2.1
            -   Displays the overall average crop damage caused by each
                weather event type based on all the cases of weather
                events that resulted in non-zero crop damage.  
        -   Plot 2.2.2
            -   Displays the average crop damage caused by each weather
                event type based on 90% of weather events with the
                lowest impact (for each weather event type) that
                resulted in non-zero crop damage.  
        -   Plot 2.2.3
            -   Displays the average crop damage caused by each weather
                event type based on 10% of weather events with the
                highest impact (for each weather event type) that
                resulted in non-zero crop damage.  
        -   Plot 2.2.4
            -   Displays a comparison for each weather event type, of
                the average crop damage for the 90% of its observations
                with the lowest impact versus the average crop damage
                for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact
                based only on the weather events that resulted in
                non-zero crop damage.  
-   **PART 3**
    -   Contains the *Multiplot 2.3* which displays the results for the
        harm on economy with respect to economic damage by each weather
        event type for all the aspects that were examined. It consists
        of four plots:
        -   Plot 2.3.1
            -   Displays the overall average economic damage caused by
                each weather event type based on all the cases of
                weather events that resulted in non-zero economic
                damage.  
        -   Plot 2.3.2
            -   Displays the average economic damage caused by each
                weather event type based on 90% of weather events with
                the lowest impact (for each weather event type) that
                resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
        -   Plot 2.3.3
            -   Displays the average economic damage caused by each
                weather event type based on 10% of weather events with
                the highest impact (for each weather event type) that
                resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
        -   The Plot 2.3.4
            -   Displays a comparison for each weather event type, of
                the average economic damage for the 90% of its
                observations with the lowest impact versus the average
                economic damage for the 10% of its observations with the
                highest impact based only on the weather events that
                resulted in non-zero economic damage.
