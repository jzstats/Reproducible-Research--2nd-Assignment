## 2.1 About The Assignment {#ind-2-1--About-The-Assignment}  

This project was created for the 2nd peer-graded assignment of:  

> Course 5: Reproducible Research,  
> from Data Science Specialization,  
> by Johns Hopkins University,  
> at Coursera   

The course is taught by:  

* Jeff Leek, PhD  
* Roger D. Peng, PhD  
* Brian Caffo, PhD  

As putted by the teachers of the course:  

> The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database 
and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. 
You must use the database to answer the questions below 
and show the code for your entire analysis. 
Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. 
You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.


The assignment requests to address 2 questions:

> Your data analysis must address the following questions:  
>  
> **Question 1:** Across the United States, which types of events 
(as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to 
population health?  
>  
> **Question 2:** Across the United States, which types of events have 
the greatest economic consequences?  

based on the observation from the [supplied dataset
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2):

> The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file 
compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size.  

Some quite general guidelines and a tip were provided:

> Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or 
municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events
and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events.
However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.  

> The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. 
In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, 
most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered 
more complete.  

It was deliberately decided to adopt a more educational approach 
aiming to produce a well-justified and self-explained product 
that can serve as guide to a beginner on how a basic pipeline 
can be constructed in order to obtain a report with an analysis from scratch.  

**All the requirements for the assignment were followed, with one exception:**  

* __due to the book-like structure 
that was adopted for the report 
it was considered more appropriate 
to include the [SYNOPSIS](#ind-3--SYNOPSIS) 
not immediately after the title, 
but as a separate chapter after the 
[PROLOGUE](#ind-2--PROLOGUE)__

## 2.2 About The Main Script {#ind-2-2--About-The-Main-Script}  

In the github repository 
https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment, 
that hosts all the material relevant to this project 
the main script [RepRes_____analysis.Rmd
](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/blob/master/RepRes_analysis.Rmd) 
that contains the code used to conduct the analysis can be found.  

When *knitted* directly from RStudio, it produces the Markdown file 
[RepRes_____analysis.md
](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/blob/master/RepRes_analysis.md)
with the analysis.  

In addition, it was rendered with appropriate scripts, 
(as explained at the following section of this chapter, 
[2.3 About The Report](#ind-2-3--About-The-Report))
to produce some html variations of the report 
that were used to populate the 
[webpage](https://jzstats.github.io/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/) 
that was created to showcase this project.

# 3 SYNOPSIS {#ind-3--SYNOPSIS}  
***  

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) 
*Storm Events Database*, was explored to identify 
the most harmful weather event types, 
among the weather phenomena defined in 
_NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007 (*at chapter 7*)_,
with respect to population health and economy.  

The raw data was loaded in R from the supplied file, 
preproccessed, 
the target data subset was extracted, 
in-record validation was conducted, 
the majority of missing values were imputed 
(via a deterministic and conservative approach), 
the observations were cross validated 
and finally the table with the processed data was created, 
which contained all information needed 
to address the two questions of interest:  

  1. Across the United States, which types of events 
  (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) 
  are most harmful with respect to population health?  
  2. Across the United States, 
  which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?  

For the first question, 
the harm on population health by each weather event type was 
evaluated (separately) based on the average impact of the observations 
that resulted in non-zero damage over each of the three perspectives 
(fatalities, injuries and casualties) that were considered to be of importance.  

Similarly for the second question,
the harm on economy by each weather event type was 
evaluated (separately) based on the average impact from the observations 
that resulted in non-zero damage over each of the three perspectives 
(property damage, crop damage and economic damage) 
that were considered to be of importance.

Although for both questions 
the main criterion to rank the included weather event types 
(from the most harmful to the least) for each perspective
was the overall average damage observed 
(with respect to each perspective) 
based on the observations that caused non-zero damage, 
the average for the 90% of cases with lowest impact 
versus the average for the 10% of cases with the highest impact 
(for each of the included weather event types) 
was reported to provide a more complete and insightful 'picture' 
of the consequences observed by each weather event type, 
due to the fact that for all perspectives, 
the majority of weather event types were highly positively skewed.  

The analysis was structured, performed and documented in such way 
that fortifies the reproducibility of the report 
and explains every required detail so that even the non-expert 
can follow the procedure and understand the thought process 
behind the decision making at each stage.

# 4 STORM EVENTS DATASET {#ind-4--STORM-EVENTS-DATASET}  
***  

To conduct the analysis for this project, 
the file with the raw data [repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
was used, 
which contains data from the *Storm Events Dataset*
gathered and made publicly available 
by U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

Some [general information](#ind-4-1--General-Informations) 
as well as two [points of interest](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest) 
about the dataset:  

* [4.2.1 Changes in the composition of weather event types
](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)  
* [4.2.2 Eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset
](#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset)  
  
were discussed to provide the nessecary insights 
in order to understand why the decisions which govern 
the approach adopted in this analysis were made.

## 4.1 General Informations {#ind-4-1--General-Informations}  

The version of the dataset used in this analysis 
contains observations for the severe weather events 
that happened (or more accurately begun) 
from January 1950 to November 2011 at United States.  

Further details about the dataset (which was used in this analysis) 
can be accessed by the supplemental material 
provided at the instructions of the assignment:

## 4.2 Points Of Interest {#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest}  

In order to understand why some of the decisions 
which govern the approach adopted in this analysis were made, 
it is essential to take into account 
two crucial facts with respect to the observations recorded in the dataset:  

  * [4.2.1 Changes in the composition of weather event types
  ](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)  
    * Both the composition of the weather events types
    that were recorded in the dataset 
    and the way the data was entered in the system 
    (the data entry procedure and the database software)
    changed several times across the years.  
  * [4.2.2 Eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset
  ](#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset)  
    * Not every weather event that occurred 
    in the period that the dataset spans,
    was automatically eligible to be recorded in the dataset. 
    Only those that have caused harm (either to population health or to economy)  
    or have gathered public interest were recorded.  

<br>  

<font size="1">[back to start of this section](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest)</font>  
<font size="1">[back to start of this chapter](#ind-4--STORM-EVENTS-DATASET)</font>  
<font size="1">[back to *TABLE OF CONTENTS*](#ind-1--TABLE-OF-CONTENTS)</font>  

<br>  

### 4.2.1 Changes in the composition of weather event types {#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types}  

Through the years, as the publicity of the dataset soared, 
several aspects governing the data collection procedure changed 
in order to expand, enrich and fortify the quality of the data.  

As a result the number of defined weather event types 
that were collected increased several times starting from just one (*TORNADO*) 
for the first few years and expanding into 48 defined weather event times 
at the time the dataset used in this analysis was created. 
Consequently there are inconsistencies in the the composition of weather event types 
between different periods that could affect the integrity of the analysis.  

Furthermore for the period 1996 up to 2000 
while the weather event types that were being recorded 
had already been significantly increased, 
the values for the weather event type entries were entered 
though a free text field 
resulting in more than 950 different unique entries.  

For this reason **it was decided to use for the analysis 
only the part with observations since January 2001**, 
for which as a result of the introduction of a drop down menu 
and the removal of the free text field
for the entries of the weather event type values, 
the majority of observations don't suffer from such problems 
and the weather event types contained include the majority 
of the latest defined weather event types.

<font size="1">[back to *TABLE OF CONTENTS*](#ind-1--TABLE-OF-CONTENTS)</font>  

<br>  
<br>  


### 4.2.2 Eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset {#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset}  

Out of all weather events that happened 
in the period from January 2001 to November 2011 at United States 
and were classified as one of the types that were recorded 
(at the period they occurred), 
only those in the subset that belonged 
to at least one of the following three groups 
were eligible to be included in the dataset:  

  1. The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena 
  having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, 
  significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce.  
  2. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention.  
  3. Other significant meteorological events, 
  such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation 
  that occur in connection with another event.  

An important implication of the above policy must be highlighted:  

* From all the weather phenomena that happened 
in the period from January 2001 to November 2011 at United States 
and were of a type that was recorded at the time they occurred,
the dataset contains only the subset with those 
that either resulted in harm (to population health or to economy) 
or gathered high publicity.  
* On the contrary all the weather phenomena that happened 
in the period from January 2001 to November 2011 at United States 
and neither caused any harm (to population health or to economy) 
nor gathered high public interest,
were ignored, even if they were of a type 
that was recorded at the time they occurred.  

Consequently any conclusion made for a weather event type in *general* 
will inevitably be biased, as it will overestimate the 
consequences with respect to the harm they caused 
(either to population health or to economy) 
due to the fact that the available sample is not representative of the 
the overall population of weather phenomena (of the types that were recorded)
by default.  


For this reason **it was decided to use for the analysis:**  

* __Only the subset of observations that resulted in non-zero harm 
with respect to each of the perspectives of interest
(fatalities, injuries and casualties)
in order to determine the most harmful weather event types 
for the population health.__  
* __Only the subset of observations that resulted in non-zero harm 
with respect to each of the perspectives of interest
(property damage, crop damage and economic damage) 
in order to determine the most harmful weather event types 
for the economy.__

# 5 PRELIMINARY ACTIVITIES {#ind-5--PRELIMINARY-ACTIVITIES}  
***  

Executes four preliminary tasks 
in order to ensure (and set when it is needed and possible) 
that the working directory and the R session 
are ready to proceed with the analysis:  

* [5.1 Set The Random Seed](#ind-5-1--Set-The-Random-Seed)  
  * Sets a random seed to make the random events reproducible.  
* [5.2 Load All Required Libraries](#ind-5-2--Load-All-Required-Libraries)  
  * Loads all libraries required to conduct the analysis and produce the report.  
* [5.3 Create All Required Directories](#ind-5-3--Create-All-Required-Directories)  
  * Creates (if it doesn't exist) a directory tree (at the working directory) 
  in which the output files will be exported.  
* [5.4 Access The File With The Raw Data](#ind-5-4--Access-The-File-With-The-Raw-Data)  
  * Downloads the file with the raw data, [repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
  ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)

## 5.1 Set The Random Seed {#ind-5-1--Set-The-Random-Seed}  

In an attempt to fortify the reproducibility of the random events, 
the number *1234567890* was explicitly chosen and set as the random seed.  

```{r set_a_random_seed_for_the_execution_of_the_script}

# Select a random seed.
selected_random_seed <- 1234567890

# Set the selected random seed.
set.seed(selected_random_seed)

```

*Note that the only random events that took place in this analysis 
were the assignment of random positions for the labels at the plots:  * 

* _[Plot 1.1.4](#ind-8-1-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-1-1-4)_

## 5.3 Create All Required Directories {#ind-5-3--Create-All-Required-Directories}  

During the execution of the main script, [RepRes_analysis.Rmd
   ](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/blob/master/RepRes_analysis.Rmd) 
several outputs are produced, 
(that are also included in the report), 
mostly to enhance further the reproducibility of the analysis. 

All those files are exported in appropriate sub-directories 
inside the directory with name *outputs* 
which is created at the working directory.  

```{r create_the_directory_tree_for_the_outputs_of_the_script}

# 6 DATA PROCESSING {#ind-6--DATA-PROCESSING}  
***  

The data processing pipeline, started with a supplied file,
[*repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2*
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
that contained raw data from the 
[*Storm Events Dataset*](#ind-4--STORM-EVENTS-DATASET)
and produced the [table with the processed data](#ind-7--PROCESSED-DATA).  

The pipeline consists of seven distinct stages:  

  1. [**Load The Raw Data In R**](#ind-6-1--Load-The-Raw-Data-In_R)  
     * The table with the raw data was created 
     by loading in R the raw data from the supplied file 
     with the compressed raw data with all variables coerced to character type. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the raw data was presented.  
  2. [**Preprocess The Raw Data**](#ind-6-2--Preprocess-The-Raw-Data)  
     * From the data at the table with the raw data, 
     in order to create the table with the preprocessed data 
     prerequisites were verified about the variables required for the analysis 
     before they were selected, coerced to their appropriate types 
     and a key was set for the table. Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the preprocessed data was presented.  
  3. [**6.3 Extract The Target Data Subset**](#ind-6-3--Extract-The-Target-Data-Subset)  
     * From the table with the preprocessed data only the subset of data 
     that includes the observations for the weather events 
     that happened in the period from 2001 to 2011 
     and caused non-zero fatalities, injuries, property damage or crop damage 
     were extracted. Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the target data subset was presented.  
  4. [**Conduct In-Record Data Validation**](#ind-6-4--Conduct-In-Record-Data-Validation)  
     * The values of each variable at the table with the target data subset 
     were validated against appropriate constrains for each column separately 
     (independently of the other variables) 
     and those entries that were found invalid got substituted with NAs 
     to create the table with the in-record validated data. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the in-record validated data was presented.  
  5. [**Impute Missing Values**](#ind-6-5--Impute-Missing-Values)  
     * The missing values at each variable 
     from the table with the in-record validated data were examined 
     and the those that could be retrieved 
     (via a deterministic and conservative way) were imputed,
     to produce the table with the imputed data. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the imputed data was presented.  
  6. [**Conduct Cross-Record Data Validation**](#ind-6-6--Conduct-Cross-Record-Data-Validation)  
     * Each observations from the table with the imputed data 
     was validated against appropriate constrains 
     that spanned across all available variables 
     and only those that were found valid
     were used to create the table with the cross-record validated data. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the cross-record validated data was presented.  
  7. [**6.7 Produce The Processed Data**](#ind-6-7--Produce-The-Processed-Data)  
     * From the table with the cross-record validated data, 
     by transforming appropriately the available information,
     the table with the processed data was created 
     that contained the variables required 
     to identify the most harmful weather event types 
     with respect to the population health and for the economy. 
     Post validation was conducted.  

At each stage of the data processing procedure 
any fact that played a major role 
was highlighted and examined when it was needed, 
in compliance with the spirit of the assignment, 
aiming to supply all the facts necessary to understand how and why 
the decision making behind this analysis happened 
in order to create a well justified and documented, reproducible report.

### 6.1.1 Create the table with the raw data {#ind-6-1-1--Create-the-table-with-the-raw-data}  

The raw data was loaded in R directly from the supplied file 
[repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
(which was a CSV file, compressed via a bzip2 algorithm),
with all variables deliberately coerced to character type 
in order to ensure that no information was lost or altered 
as a side effect of coercion. 
The first row of the file includes headers that were used 
to automatically assign the names of all the variables 
at the table with the raw data that was created.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Load the raw data in R from the supplied file:
#     "repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2"
# and create the table with the raw data.
raw_data <- fread(
  ## the file is expected to exist at the working directory
  file = filepath_____unprocessed_data,
  ## the variables in the file are separated via a comma
  sep = ",",
  ## the first row of the file contains the names of the variables
  header = TRUE,
  ## all variables were deliberately loaded as character type
  ## to avoid any loss or alteration of information as a side effect of coercion
  colClasses = "character"
)

```

### 6.1.2 Conduct post validation for the table with the raw data {#ind-6-1-2--Conduct-post-validation-for-the-table-with-the-raw-data}  

The table with the raw data was post validated to ensure 
that the data from the file was loaded in R correctly.  
Three simple constrains were applied:  

   1. It should contain 37 variables.  
   2. It should contain 902297 observations.  
   3. The type of all variables should be 'character'.  

*(The expected number of variables and the expected number of observations, 
were acquired interactively before the execution of the main script 
[RepRes_analysis.Rmd
](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/blob/master/RepRes_analysis.Rmd) 
and were then used to form the constrains for the post validation.)*

```{r conduct_post_validation_for_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Create a validator with constrains for the validity of loaded raw data. 
V_____loaded_raw_data <- validator(
  ## create a character vector that captures the class of each variable
  classes_of_varirables := vapply(
    X = ., 
    ### although it is not expected to get an output 
    ### with more than one element for the class of each variable, 
    ### in general it is possible to happen, 
    ### so proper care is taken to collapse the elements of such vector 
    ### in a single element so that the vapply() function 
    ### won't fail with an error in such case
    FUN = function(x) paste(class(x), collapse = ","), 
    FUN.VALUE = character(1)
  ),
  "expected_number_of_variables" = ( length(.) == 37 ),
  "expected_number_of_observations" = ( nrow(.) == 902297 ),
  "expected_variable_types" = ( classes_of_varirables == "character" )
)

# Confront the table with the raw data with the validator
# which constrains the constrains for the validity of raw data.
CF_____loaded_raw_data <- confront(dat = raw_data, V_____loaded_raw_data)

```

The table with the raw data was valid.  

```{r create_a_kable_with_the_results_from_post_validation_of_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Create a kable with the results of post validation 
# for the table with the raw data. 
kable(
  x = summary(CF_____loaded_raw_data)[
    , 
    c("name", "items", "passes", "fails", "nNA", "error", "warning")
    ], 
  caption = paste0(

      "striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", "bordered"
    ), 
    full_width = FALSE,

### 6.1.3 Overview of the table with the raw data {#ind-6-1-3--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-raw-data}  

The table with the raw data 
contained 37 variables that were all of type 'character' 
and 902297 observations.

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Print the structure of the table with the raw data.
str(raw_data)

```

There were no missing values (coded as NAs) 
at any of the variables it contained, 
but there were a lot of empty values 
which probably represent missing values. 
For some of the variables, 
a suspiciously large or small number of distinct values was observed.  

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_facts_for_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Create a kable to highlight some facts 
# about the variables at the table with the raw data.
kable(
  data.table(
    "Variable" = names(raw_data),
    "Number of Distinct Values" = vapply(
      X = raw_data, 
      FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)), 
      FUN.VALUE = integer(1)
      ),
    "Number of NAs" = vapply(
      X = raw_data, 
      FUN = function(x) sum(is.na(x)),
      FUN.VALUE = integer(1)
      ),
    # from the output with the structure of the table with the raw data 
    # it was found that some empty values exist at some variables 
    # and the exact number that each of them contains was reported
    "Number of Empty Values" = vapply(
      X = raw_data, 
      FUN = function(x) sum(x == ""), 
      FUN.VALUE = integer(1))
    
  ),
  caption = paste0(
    "TABLE 6.1.3-2: ", 
    "Facts about the variables at the table with the raw data."
  )
) %>% 
  kable_styling(

## 6.2 Preprocess The Raw Data {#ind-6-2--Preprocess-The-Raw-Data}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

From the table with the raw data which contains 37 variables, 
only 9 were selected to create the table with preprocessed data 
and proceed with this analysis:  

  1. **REFNUM** : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **BGN_DATE** : the date when each weather event begun  
  3. **EVTYPE** : the type of each weather event  
  4. **FATALITIES** : the number of fatalities  
  5. **INJURIES** : the number of injuries  
  6. **PROPDMG** : the magnitude value of the damage caused in properties 
  that could have been expressed in thousands, millions or billions of dollars, 
  depending on the corresponding indicator value at the variable *PROPDMGEXP*  
  7. **PROPDMGEXP** : an indicator value that denotes 
  whether the corresponding magnitude value at the variable *PROPDMG*
  refers to thousands, millions or billions of dollars  
  8. **CROPDMG** : the magnitude value of the damage caused in crops 
  that could have been expressed in thousands, millions or billions of dollars, 
  depending on the corresponding indicator value at the variable *CROPDMGEXP*  
  9. **CROPDMGEXP** : an indicator value that denotes 
  whether the corresponding magnitude value at the variable *CROPDMG*
  refers to thousands, millions or billions of dollars  

Due to the fact that all variables at the table with the raw data 
were (deliberately) loaded as type 'character' 
some prerequisites were needed to get verified 
for the format of the character string values that they contained
before they were coerced to their appropriate type.   

The variable *REFNUM* after having verified 
that the values it contained uniquely identify each observation, 
was set as the key for the table with the preprocessed data. 

Finally post validation was conducted 
and some facts about the table with the preprocessed data were highlighted.

### 6.2.1 Verify the prerequisites for the selected variables {#ind-6-2-1--Verify-the-prerequisites-for-the-selected-variables}  

Two key points were checked for the values of the selected variables 
from the table with raw data before proceeding 
to create the table with the preprocessed data:  

* [6.2.1.1 Verify the coercibility of the values for the selected variables
](#ind-6-2-1-1--Verify-the-coercibility-for-the-values-at-the-selected-variables)  
  * Checks if the format of the character string values 
  of the selected variables from the table with the raw data 
  are compatible with the (variable) type 
  that each of them should be coerced to.  
* [6.2.1.2 Verify the uniqueness of the key values
](#ind-6-2-1-2--Verify-the-uniqueness-of-the-key-values)  
  * Checked if the values of the variable *REFNUM* 
  (when coerced to type 'integer')
  that was intended to be used as the key

#### 6.2.1.1 Verify the coercibility of the values for the selected variables {#ind-6-2-1-1--Verify-the-coercibility-for-the-values-at-the-selected-variables}  

The format of the character string values of the selected variables, 
*REFNUM*, *BGN_DATE*, *EVTYPE*, *FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, 
*PROPDMG*, *PROPDMGEXP*, *CROPDMG* and *CROPDMGEXP*, 
from the table with the raw data were checked in order to verify that 
they were compatible with the new variable type 
that each them should be coerced to, 
so as not to lose any information without knowing it 
(or in other words to avoid the side effect of automatic substitution by NAs, 
of the values that were incompatible 
with the new variable type that each of them should be coerced to).  

The variables *EVTYPE*, *BGN_DATE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP* 
were already in their appropriate type (which is 'character'),
so no further adjustments were needed. 
On the other hand the variables *REFNUM*, *FATALITIES* and *INJURIES* 
had to be coerced from 'character' type to 'integer',
while the type of the remaining two variables, 
*PROPDMG* and *CROPDMG* had to change from 'character' to 'double'.  

A validation was conducted to verify that:  
  
  1. the values of the variable *REFNUM* can be coerced to 'integer' type  
  2. the values of the variable *FATALITIES* can be coerced to 'integer' type  
  3. the values of the variable *INJURIES* can be coerced to 'integer' type  
  4. the values of the variable *PROPDMG* can be coerced to 'double' type  
  5. the values of the variable *CROPDMG* can be coerced to 'double' type  
  
```{r verify_the_coercibility_of_the_format_of_the_character_string_values_for_the_selected_variables}

The values of all selected variables 
were found to be compatible with the new type 
that each of them should be coerced to.

#### 6.2.1.2 Verify the uniqueness of the key values {#ind-6-2-1-2--Verify-the-uniqueness-of-the-key-values}  

The variable *REFNUM*, coerced to its proper type (that is 'integer'),
should and was expected to uniquely identify each observation, 
making it an excellent choice 
for the key of the table with the preprocessed data, 
(as well as for the rest of the tables that were generated 
at the following stages of the data processing pipeline).  

Before proceeding to set the *REFNUM* as the key, 
the claim that *it uniquely identifies each observations* 
was checked to avoid unexpected surprises 
that may jeopardize the reproducibility of the analysis.  

```{r verify_the_uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_variable}

# Create a validator for the uniqueness of values at the variable REFNUM.
V_____uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_of_the_table <- validator(
  "value_uniquely_identifies_the_observation" = (
    # the values of the variable REFNUM will be first coerced 
    # to their appropriate variable type, which is 'integer' 
    # and then checked for uniqueness
    as.integer(REFNUM) %in% 
      names(table(as.integer(REFNUM)))[table(as.integer(REFNUM)) == 1]
  )
)

# Confront the table with raw data with the validator 
# for the uniqueness of values at REFNUM variable 
CF_____uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_of_the_table <- confront(
  dat = raw_data,
  V_____uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_of_the_table
)

```

All values of the variable *REFNUM* were found to be distinct,
and consequently they uniquely identify each observation.  

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_the_results_for_the_uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_variable}

# Create a kable to present the results from the validation

### 6.2.2 Create the table with the preprocessed data {#ind-6-2-2--Create-the-table-with-the-preprocessed-data}  

Having identify the variables from the table with the raw data 
(*REFNUM*, *BGN_DATE*, *EVTYPE*, *FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, 
*PROPDMG*, *PROPDMGEXP*, *CROPDMG* and *CROPDMGEXP*) 
that were required to proceed with the analysis, 
and [verified that they satisfied the necessary prerequisites
](#ind-6-2-1--Verify-the-prerequisites-for-the-selected-variables), 
the table with preprocessed data was created,
by selecting those 9 variables, 
coercing them to their appropriate type:  

1. *REFNUM* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'integer'  
2. *BGN_DATE* was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  
3. *EVTYPE* was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  
4. *FATALITIES* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'integer'  
5. *INJURIES* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'integer'  
6. *PROPDMG* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'double'  
7. *PROPDMGEXP*  was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  
8. *CROPDMG* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'double'  
9. *CROPDMGEXP*  was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  

and finally setting the variable *REFNUM* as the key of the table.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_preprocessed_data}

# Create the table with the preprocessed data 
# with the selected variables from the table with the raw data, 
# coerced to their appropriate type.
preprocessed_data <- raw_data[

### 6.2.3 Conduct post validation for the table with the preprocessed data {#ind-6-2-3--Conduct-post-validation-for-the-table-with-the-preprocessed-data}  

The table with the preprocessed data was post validated to ensure that:

  1. all and only, the variables required for the analysis were included  
  2. all the observations from table with raw data were transfered  
  3. each of the selected variables was coerced to its appropriate type  
  4. no missing values were introduced as a result of the coercion  
  5. *REFNUM* was set as the key of the table

## 6.3 Extract The Target Data Subset {#ind-6-3--Extract-The-Target-Data-Subset}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

From all available observations 
that the table with the preprocessed data contains, 
only the subset of the weather phenomena 
that begun at 2001 or later 
and resulted in non-zero harm either to population health 
(caused fatalities or injuries) 
or to economy (caused property damage or crop damage) 
will be used for this analysis (for the reasons that were discussed in detail 
at the section [4.2 Points Of Interest](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest) 
about the *Storm Events Dataset*).  

The consistency of the format of dates at the *BGN_DATE* variable 
(that indicates when each weather phenomenon begun)
was checked, as it was intended to be used for the identification,
the eligible observations for the target data subset were identified, 
and got extracted to create the table with the target data subset.  

Finally post validation was conducted 
and some facts about the table with the target data subset were highlighted.

### 6.3.1 Identify the target subset of observations {#ind-6-3-1--Identify-the-target-subset-of-observations}  

Out of all available observations it was decided to use for the analysis 
the subset that includes only the weather phenomena 
that happened from 2001 and later (due to the implications of 
[changes in the composition of weather event types
](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)) 
and resulted in non-zero harm either to population health 
(caused fatalities or injuries) or to economy 
(caused property damage or crop damage) (due to the implications of the 
[eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset
](#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset)).  

The format of the date values at *BGN_DATE* variable 
from the table with preprocessed data 
had to be checked to see if it is consistent across all observations, 
before it was used to form the first of the two constrains. 

The eligible observations were finally identified by their key value 
(denoted by the variable *REFNUM*).  

* [6.3.1.1 Verify the consistency of date format
](#ind-6-3-1-1--Verify-the-consistency-of-date-format`)  
  * Verifies that the character string format of the values 
    at *BGN_DATE* variable are consistent. 
* [6.3.1.2 Identify the eligible observations
](#ind-6-3-1-2--Identify-the-eligible-observations)  
  * Identifies by their key value 
  the observations at the table with preprocessed data 
  that begun from 2001 or later and resulted in non-zero harm 
  either to population health (caused fatalities or injuries) 
  or to economy (caused property damage or crop damage)

#### 6.3.1.1 Verify the consistency of date format {#ind-6-3-1-1--Verify-the-consistency-of-date-format}  

The year in the value of date at the variable *BGN_DATE* 
was intended to be used as one of the two criteria to 
identify the eligible observations for the target data subset at the 
[next subsubsection](#ind-6-3-1-2--Identify-the-eligible-observations).  

That's why it is crucial at this point, 
to verify that the values of date are in the expected format, 
which as indicated by the [overview of the table with preprocessed data
](#ind-6-2-4--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-preprocessed-data) 
(as well as some interactive examination) seems to be:  

* **MM/DD/YYYY 0:00:00**
  * *MM* stands for 2 characters for the month  
  * *DD* stands for 2 characters for the day  
  * *YYYY* stands for 4 characters for the year  
  * the value of year is followed by a space  
  * *0:00:00* is a dummy part that stands for the time  

```{r verify_the_consistency_of_format_for_the_values_of_begin_date}

# Create a validator for the format 
# of the character string values of the dates.
V____expected_character_string_format_for_begin_date <- validator(
  "expected_character_string_format_of_date" =

CF____expected_character_string_format_for_begin_date <- confront(
  dat = preprocessed_data,

```

Indeed all values for dates were found to be in the expected format.

#### 6.3.1.2 Identify the eligible observations {#ind-6-3-1-2--Identify-the-eligible-observations}

According to the discussion for the two 
[points of interest for the Storm Events Dataset](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest) 
only a subset of observations will be used for this analysis. 
This target data subset includes only the observations which refer to 
weather phenomena that simultaneously satisfy the following two criteria:  

* **begun at Jan 2011 and later** due to the implications of 
  [changes in the composition of weather event types
  ](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)

## 6.4 Conduct In-Record Data Validation {#ind-6-4--Conduct-In-Record-Data-Validation}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

Through the in-record data validation stage
the values of each variable from the table with the target data subset 
were examined independently of the corresponding values at other variables, 
in order to identify invalid entries 
which were then substituted by missing values (coded properly as NA)
to create the table with the in-record validated data.  

Finally post validation was conducted 
and some facts about the table with the in-record validated data 
were highlighted.

### 6.4.2 Conduct in-record data validation for each variable {#ind-6-4-2--Conduct-in-record-data-validation-for-each-variable}  

To create the constrains for the in-record validation for each variable 
from the table with the target data subset, some 'common world knowledge' 
combined with information provided by the *Storm Data Documentation* 
about the [valid values of the available variables
](#ind-6-4-1--Introduce-information-from-the-Strom-Data-Documentation) 
were used.  

Specifically:  

1. The *REFNUM* variable's values must be unique for each observations.  
2. the *BGN_DATE* variable's value must contain a year part that is from 2001 up to 2011
3. The *EVTYPE* variable's values must be one of the 
[48 defined events types](#ind-6-4-1-1--Valid-values-for-the-EVTYPE-variable).  
4. The *FATALITIES* variable's values must be non-negative.  
5. The *INJURIES* variable's values must be non-negative. 
6. The *PROPDMG* variable's values must be non-negative.  
7. The *PROPDMGEXP* variable's values must be *K*, *M* or *B*.  
8. The *CROPDMG* variable's values must be non negative.  
9. The *CROPDMGEXP* variable's values must be *K*, *M* or *B*.

Although unnecessary to test the constrains for all variables,
that were included in the table with the target data subset 
(the uniqueness of the values in key variable *REFNUM*,
the fact the year indicated in the *BGN_DATE* variable was from 2001 to 2011 
as well as the fact that the values of the variables 
*FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, *CROPDMG*, *PROPDMG* were non-negative), 
because some of them had been verified 
in previous stages of the data processing procedure,
such tests were included in order to provided a detailed and complete 
overview of all the in-record constrains for the entries  
of each variable at the validated data table.  

Actually only the variables *EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP* 
needed to be validated in this stage, 
as these were the ones that haven't been checked properly yet.  

```{r conduct_in_record_validation_for_the_variables_at_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset}

# Create a validator with constrains for the in-record validation 
# for the values of each variable.
V____constrains_for_the_in_record_data_validation <- validator(
  "REFNUM" = ( REFNUM %in% names(table(REFNUM))[table(REFNUM) == 1] ),
  "BGN_DATE" = ( 
    as.integer(
      str_extract(BGN_DATE, "(?<=^\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/)\\d{4}(?= 0:00:00$)")
    ) %in%
      c(2001:2011)

  "PROPDMG" = ( PROPDMG >= 0 ),
  "PROPDMGEXP" = ( PROPDMGEXP %in% defined_property_damage_exponents ),
  "CROPDMG" = ( CROPDMG >= 0 ),
  "CROPDMGEXP" = ( CROPDMGEXP %in% defined_crop_damage_exponents )
)

# Confront the table with target data subset with the validator 
# which contains the constrains for the in-record data validation. 
CF____constrains_for_the_in_record_data_validation <- confront(
  dat = target_data_subset,
  V____constrains_for_the_in_record_data_validation
)

```

According to the results of the in-record data validation, 
there is a significant proportion of invalid values found 
at the variables *EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP*.  

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_the_results_from_the_in_record_validation_for_the_variables_at_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset}

The invalid values for each variable were identified by their key value 
(denoted by the variable *REFNUM*).

### 6.4.5 Overview of the table with the in-record validated data {#ind-6-4-5--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-in-record-validated-data}  

The table with the in-record validated data contained 9 variables 
and 144826 observations.  

The variable *REFNUM* was set as the key of table.

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_in_record_validated_data}

# Print the structure of the table with the in-record validated data table .
str(in_record_validated_data)

```

There were plenty of missing values, 
that were introduced as a result of the in-record validation procedure
for the variables *EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP*, 
but the number of distinct values didn't indicate any more 
the presence of obvious abnormalities.

## 6.5 Impute Missing Values {#ind-6-5--Impute-Missing-Values}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

In this stage of data processing procedure,
an attempt was made to maximize 
the amount of available information for the analysis,
by imputing some of the missing values 
that exist at the table with the in-record validated data 
with plausible values.

There were 3 variables (*EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP*) 
that contained NAs, all of which were introduced through the 
[in-record data validation stage](#ind-6-4--Conduct-In-Record-Data-Validation). 

Via a conservative deterministic approach 
which aimed to retrieve the missing values 
only for the cases that there were almost no doubt 
about the values that were imputed,
the majority of those entries got successfully restored.

However it is highlighted that for the variable *EVTYPE*, 
there is no guarantee that the values imputed are error-free, 
due to the fact that the associations were made based on the invalid values 
found at the table with the target data subset, 
that were substituted by NAs and the information available in 
[NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)
(at chapter 7)*  
by the analyst who has **no expertise neither on weather nor in meteorology**. 

On the other hand, the missing values that were imputed 
for the variables *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP* 
are almost certainly correct 
(and even if they are not,
it didn't affect in any significant way the results of the analysis 
as they all correspond to observations 
that resulted in 0 property and crop damage respectively 
while the analysis focused on the observations for the weather events 
that caused non-zero harm).  

```{r create_a_dummy_table_for_imputed_data_as_a_copy_of_the_table_with_in_record_validated_data} 

# Create a dummy table by coping the table with the in-record validated data 
# at which the missing values for the variable EVTYPE, PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP 
# will be imputed to get the table with the imputed data.
imputed_data <- copy(in_record_validated_data)

#### 6.5.1.1 Examine the invalid values from the variable EVTYPE {#ind-6-5-1-1--Examine-the-invalid-values-from-the-variable-EVTYPE}  

For the variable *EVTYPE* at the table with the in-record validated data, 
out of the total 144826 observations 32775 (22.63%) were NAs.

These 32775 missing values at the table with the in-record validated data, 
corresponded to 51 distinct invalid entries

#### 6.5.1.2 Associate plausible substitutions to the invalid values from the variable EVTYPE {#ind-6-5-1-2--Associate-plausible-substitutions-to-the-invalid-values-from-the-variable-EVTYPE}

To impute the corresponding NAs associations were made 
from the invalid entries to defined weather event types.  

* Some of the associations were based solely on the invalid values,
which directly corresponded to defined event types 
as they seem to be either typos 
(e.g. "RIP CURRENTS" instead of "RIP CURRENT") 
or acronyms of the expected values 
(e.g. "TSTM WIND" instead of "THUNDERSTORM WIND").  
* While for others the description for each one of the 48 event types 
that was available in 
[NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)
*(at chapter 7)* was taken into account 
for cases where a variation of the defined value had been supplied 
(e.g. "URBAN/SML STREAM FLD" instead of "HEAVY RAIN").  

**Nevertheless it is stressed 
that the associations mainly depend on 'common sense' judgment 
(instead of solid professional expertise)
and in no way they are guaranteed to be error-free,
despite the best efforts made to impute only the most obvious cases.**  

In total, 28 distinct invalid values were associated 
to some of the 48 defined weather event types:

Out of the total 32775 missing values

### 6.6.1 Identify all valid observations {#ind-6-6-1--Identify-all-valid-observations}  

A single constrain that spanned across all available variables 
at the table with the imputed data was created and used 
to identify the valid observations.  

Specifically, each observation must simultaneous satisfy the 4 criteria below 
in order to be considered valid:  
  
  1. The id must be unique (and non-missing).  
  2. The weather event type value must be 
  one of the defined weather events (and non-missing).  
  3. The year must be in the period from 2001 to 2011 (and non-missing).  
  4. There must be non-zero harm either to population health or to economy, so:
     * either fatalities must be positive (and non-missing), 
     * or injuries must be positive (and non-missing), 
     * or property damage (in dollars) must be retrievable and positive (and non-missing), 
     * or crop damage (in dollars) must be retrievable and positive (and non-missing).  

```{r conduct_cross_record_validation_for_the_observations_at_table_with_the_imputed_data}

# A validator was created that contains a constrain 
# for the validity of each observation 
# that spans across all variables .

          c(2001:2011) ) &
      (
        ( FATALITIES > 0 ) |

# the observations that contain valid values across all variables. 
CF_____cross_record_constrains <- confront(
  dat = imputed_data,
  V_____cross_record_constrains
)

```

Out of the total of 144826 observation at the table with the imputed data 
144571 were valid across all variables while only 255 were found to be invalid.

```{r create_a_kable_with_the_results_of_cross_record_validation_for_the_observations_at_the_table_with_the_imputed_data}

  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), 
    full_width = FALSE,
    fixed_thead = TRUE
  )

```

The value of the key (denoted by the variable *REFNUM*) 
was used to identify the observations that were valid. 

```{r identify_the_cross_record_valid_observation_at_the_table_with_the_imputed_data_by_their_key_value}

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

Having identified, validated and imputed 
the target data for the period of interest,
by transforming the variables from the table with cross-record validated data, 
the processed data table was constructed 
that contained all information that was necessary 
in order to proceed with this analysis 
and address the two questions of interest.

### 6.7.1 Create the table with the processed data {#ind-6-7-1--Create-the-table-with-the-processed-data}  

The following transformations were applied 
at the variables from the table with the cross-record validated data, 
in order to construct the table with the processed data: 
  
  1. the variable **REFNUM** was transfered unchanged  
  2. the variable *BGN_DATE* was omitted  
  3. the variable *EVTYPE* was transfered and renamed to **EVENT_TYPE**  
  4. the variable **FATALITIES** was transfered unchanged  
  5. the variable **INJURIES** was transfered unchanged  
  6. the variables *FATALITIES* and *INJURIES* were added  
  in order to create the variable **CASUALTIES**  
  7. the variables *PROPDMG* (that denoted the magnitude of property damage) 
  and *PROPDMGEXP* (that indicated if the value of *PROPDMG* referred to 
  thousands, millions or billions)
  were combined appropriately to retrieve the property damage in dollars 
  in order to create the variable **PROPERTY_DAMAGE**  
  8. the variables *CROPDMG* (that denoted the magnitude of crop damage) 
  and *CROPDMGEXP* (that indicated if the value of *CROPDMG* referred to 
  thousands, millions or billions)
  were combined appropriately to retrieve the crop damage in dollars 
  in order to create the variable **CROP_DAMAGE**  
  9. the variables *PROPERTY_DAMAGE* and *CROP_DAMAGE* were added 
  in order to create the variable **ECONOMIC_DAMAGE**

### 6.7.2 Conduct post validation for the table with the processed data {#ind-6-7-2--Conduct-post-validation-for-the-table-with-the-processed-data}  

Post validation was conducted to verify that all observations 
contained at the table with the processed data were valid 
across all variables it contained.  

One constrain was created and used, which consists of three parts 
that must hold simultaneous for each observation:  
  
  * The key for each observation denoted by the variable *REFNUM* must be unique.  
  * The event type for each observation denoted by the variable *EVENT_TYPE* 
  must be one of 48 defined weather event types according to the 
  *NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007 (at chapter 7)*  
  * At least one of the six variables that indicate the harm 
  (either to population health or to economy), 
  denoted by the variables *FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, *CASUALTIES*, 
  *PROPERTY_DAMAGE*, *CROP_DAMAGE* or *EC0NOMIC_DAMAGE* must be positive.  

```{r conduct_post_validation_for_the_table_with_the_processed_data}

# Create a validator that contains a constrain 
# that spans across all variables contained 
# at the table with the processed data 
# for each observation it includes.
V_____post_validation_of_table_with_the_processed_data <- validator(
  "valid_observation" = (
    ( REFNUM %in% table(REFNUM)[names(table(REFNUM)[table(REFNUM) == 1])] ) &
      ( EVENT_TYPE %in% defined_event_types ) &
      ( FATALITIES > 0 ) |
      ( INJURIES > 0 ) |
      ( CASUALTIES > 0) |
      ( PROPERTY_DAMAGE > 0 ) |
      ( CROP_DAMAGE > 0) |
      ( ECONOMIC_DAMAGE > 0 )
  )
)

# Confront the table with the processed data with 
# validator that verifies the validity of each observation it contains 
# across all variables.
CF_____post_validation_of_table_with_the_processed_data <- confront(
  dat = processed_data,
  V_____post_validation_of_table_with_the_processed_data
)


```

All the 144571 observations included in the processed data table 
were found to satisfy the condition.

```{r create_a_kable_with_the_results_from_post_validation_of_the_table_with_the_processed_data}

# Create a kable to resents the results of post validation 
# for the table with the processed data.
