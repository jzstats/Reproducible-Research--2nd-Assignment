## 2.1 About The Assignment {#ind-2-1--About-The-Assignment}  

This project was created for the 2nd peer-graded assignment of:  

> Course 5: Reproducible Research,  
> from Data Science Specialization,  
> by Johns Hopkins University,  
> at Coursera   

The course is taught by:  

* Jeff Leek, PhD  
* Roger D. Peng, PhD  
* Brian Caffo, PhD  

As putted by the teachers of the course:  

> The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database 
and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. 
You must use the database to answer the questions below 
and show the code for your entire analysis. 
Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. 
You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.


The assignment requests to address 2 questions:

> Your data analysis must address the following questions:  
>  
> **Question 1:** Across the United States, which types of events 
(as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to 
population health?  
>  
> **Question 2:** Across the United States, which types of events have 
the greatest economic consequences?  

based on the observation from the [supplied dataset
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2):

> The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file 
compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size.  

Some quite general guidelines and a tip were provided:

> Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or 
municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events
and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events.
However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.  

> The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. 
In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, 
most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered 
more complete.  

It was deliberately decided to adopt a more educational approach 
aiming to produce a well-justified and self-explained product 
that can serve as guide to a beginner on how a basic pipeline 
can be constructed in order to obtain a report with an analysis from scratch.  

**All the requirements for the assignment were followed, with one exception:**  

* __due to the book-like structure 
that was adopted for the report 
it was considered more appropriate 
to include the [SYNOPSIS](#ind-3--SYNOPSIS) 
not immediately after the title, 
but as a separate chapter after the 
[PROLOGUE](#ind-2--PROLOGUE)__

# 3 SYNOPSIS {#ind-3--SYNOPSIS}  
***  

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) 
*Storm Events Database*, was explored to identify 
the most harmful weather event types, 
among the weather phenomena defined in 
_NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007 (*at chapter 7*)_,
with respect to population health and economy.  

The raw data was loaded in R from the supplied file, 
preproccessed, 
the target data subset was extracted, 
in-record validation was conducted, 
the majority of missing values were imputed 
(via a deterministic and conservative approach), 
the observations were cross validated 
and finally the table with the processed data was created, 
which contained all information needed 
to address the two questions of interest:  

  1. Across the United States, which types of events 
  (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) 
  are most harmful with respect to population health?  
  2. Across the United States, 
  which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?  

For the first question, 
the harm on population health by each weather event type was 
evaluated (separately) based on the average impact of the observations 
that resulted in non-zero damage over each of the three perspectives 
(fatalities, injuries and casualties) that were considered to be of importance.  

Similarly for the second question,
the harm on economy by each weather event type was 
evaluated (separately) based on the average impact from the observations 
that resulted in non-zero damage over each of the three perspectives 
(property damage, crop damage and economic damage) 
that were considered to be of importance.

Although for both questions 
the main criterion to rank the included weather event types 
(from the most harmful to the least) for each perspective
was the overall average damage observed 
(with respect to each perspective) 
based on the observations that caused non-zero damage, 
the average for the 90% of cases with lowest impact 
versus the average for the 10% of cases with the highest impact 
(for each of the included weather event types) 
was reported to provide a more complete and insightful 'picture' 
of the consequences observed by each weather event type, 
due to the fact that for all perspectives, 
the majority of weather event types were highly positively skewed.  

The analysis was structured, performed and documented in such way 
that fortifies the reproducibility of the report 
and explains every required detail so that even the non-expert 
can follow the procedure and understand the thought process 
behind the decision making at each stage.

# 4 STORM EVENTS DATASET {#ind-4--STORM-EVENTS-DATASET}  
***  

To conduct the analysis for this project, 
the file with the raw data [repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
was used, 
which contains data from the *Storm Events Dataset*
gathered and made publicly available 
by U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

Some [general information](#ind-4-1--General-Informations) 
as well as two [points of interest](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest) 
about the dataset:  

* [4.2.1 Changes in the composition of weather event types
](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)  
* [4.2.2 Eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset
](#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset)  
  
were discussed to provide the nessecary insights 
in order to understand why the decisions which govern 
the approach adopted in this analysis were made.

## 4.1 General Informations {#ind-4-1--General-Informations}  

The version of the dataset used in this analysis 
contains observations for the severe weather events 
that happened (or more accurately begun) 
from January 1950 to November 2011 at United States.  

Further details about the dataset (which was used in this analysis) 
can be accessed by the supplemental material 
provided at the instructions of the assignment:

For additional information on the Storm Events Dataset, 
as well as an updated and cleaner version of the data, 
with observations from January 1950 up to January 2020
(at the time this report was produced, 
but it is expected to continue updating),
it is recommended to visit and explore:

## 4.2 Points Of Interest {#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest}  

In order to understand why some of the decisions 
which govern the approach adopted in this analysis were made, 
it is essential to take into account 
two crucial facts with respect to the observations recorded in the dataset:  

  * [4.2.1 Changes in the composition of weather event types
  ](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)  
    * Both the composition of the weather events types
    that were recorded in the dataset 
    and the way the data was entered in the system 
    (the data entry procedure and the database software)
    changed several times across the years.  
  * [4.2.2 Eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset
  ](#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset)  
    * Not every weather event that occurred 
    in the period that the dataset spans,
    was automatically eligible to be recorded in the dataset. 
    Only those that have caused harm (either to population health or to economy)  
    or have gathered public interest were recorded.  

<br>

<font size="1">[back to *TABLE OF CONTENTS*](#ind-1--TABLE-OF-CONTENTS)</font>  

<br>  

### 4.2.1 Changes in the composition of weather event types {#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types}  

Through the years, as the publicity of the dataset soared, 
several aspects governing the data collection procedure changed 
in order to expand, enrich and fortify the quality of the data.  

As a result the number of defined weather event types 
that were collected increased several times starting from just one (*TORNADO*) 
for the first few years and expanding into 48 defined weather event times 
at the time the dataset used in this analysis was created. 
Consequently there are inconsistencies in the the composition of weather event types 
between different periods that could affect the integrity of the analysis.  

Furthermore for the period 1996 up to 2000 
while the weather event types that were being recorded 
had already been significantly increased, 
the values for the weather event type entries were entered 
though a free text field 
resulting in more than 950 different unique entries.  

For this reason **it was decided to use for the analysis 
only the part with observations since January 2001**, 
for which as a result of the introduction of a drop down menu 
and the removal of the free text field
for the entries of the weather event type values, 
the majority of observations don't suffer from such problems 
and the weather event types contained include the majority 
of the latest defined weather event types.

<font size="1">[back to *TABLE OF CONTENTS*](#ind-1--TABLE-OF-CONTENTS)</font>  

<br>  
<br>  


### 4.2.2 Eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset {#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset}  

Out of all weather events that happened 
in the period from January 2001 to November 2011 at United States 
and were classified as one of the types that were recorded 
(at the period they occurred), 
only those in the subset that belonged 
to at least one of the following three groups 
were eligible to be included in the dataset:  

  1. The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena 
  having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, 
  significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce.  
  2. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention.  
  3. Other significant meteorological events, 
  such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation 
  that occur in connection with another event.  

An important implication of the above policy must be highlighted:  

* From all the weather phenomena that happened 
in the period from January 2001 to November 2011 at United States 
and were of a type that was recorded at the time they occurred,
the dataset contains only the subset with those 
that either resulted in harm (to population health or to economy) 
or gathered high publicity.  
* On the contrary all the weather phenomena that happened 
in the period from January 2001 to November 2011 at United States 
and neither caused any harm (to population health or to economy) 
nor gathered high public interest,
were ignored, even if they were of a type 
that was recorded at the time they occurred.  

Consequently any conclusion made for a weather event type in *general* 
will inevitably be biased, as it will overestimate the 
consequences with respect to the harm they caused 
(either to population health or to economy) 
due to the fact that the available sample is not representative of the 
the overall population of weather phenomena (of the types that were recorded)
by default.  


For this reason **it was decided to use for the analysis:**  

* __Only the subset of observations that resulted in non-zero harm 
with respect to each of the perspectives of interest
(fatalities, injuries and casualties)
in order to determine the most harmful weather event types 
for the population health.__  
* __Only the subset of observations that resulted in non-zero harm 
with respect to each of the perspectives of interest
(property damage, crop damage and economic damage) 
in order to determine the most harmful weather event types 
for the economy.__

# 5 PRELIMINARY ACTIVITIES {#ind-5--PRELIMINARY-ACTIVITIES}  
***  

Executes four preliminary tasks 
in order to ensure (and set when it is needed and possible) 
that the working directory and the R session 
are ready to proceed with the analysis:  

* [5.1 Set The Random Seed](#ind-5-1--Set-The-Random-Seed)  
  * Sets a random seed to make the random events reproducible.  
* [5.2 Load All Required Libraries](#ind-5-2--Load-All-Required-Libraries)  
  * Loads all libraries required to conduct the analysis and produce the report.  
* [5.3 Create All Required Directories](#ind-5-3--Create-All-Required-Directories)  
  * Creates (if it doesn't exist) a directory tree (at the working directory) 
  in which the output files will be exported.  
* [5.4 Access The File With The Raw Data](#ind-5-4--Access-The-File-With-The-Raw-Data)  
  * Downloads the file with the raw data, [repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
  ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
  in the working directory, if it doesn't already exist.

<br>  

## 5.1 Set The Random Seed {#ind-5-1--Set-The-Random-Seed}  

In an attempt to fortify the reproducibility of the random events, 
the number *1234567890* was explicitly chosen and set as the random seed.  

```{r set_a_random_seed_for_the_execution_of_the_script}

# Select a random seed.
selected_random_seed <- 1234567890

# Set the selected random seed.
set.seed(selected_random_seed)

```

*Note that the only random events that took place in this analysis 
were the assignment of random positions for the labels at the plots:  * 

* _[Plot 1.1.4](#ind-8-1-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-1-1-4)_  
* _[Plot 1.2.4](#ind-8-2-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-1-2-4)_

## 5.3 Create All Required Directories {#ind-5-3--Create-All-Required-Directories}  

During the execution of the main script, [RepRes_analysis.Rmd
   ](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/blob/master/RepRes_analysis.Rmd) 
several outputs are produced, 
(that are also included in the report), 
mostly to enhance further the reproducibility of the analysis. 

All those files are exported in appropriate sub-directories 
inside the directory with name *outputs* 
which is created at the working directory.  

```{r create_the_directory_tree_for_the_outputs_of_the_script}

# Create a list with the paths to all sub-directories 
# of the directory tree for the outputs of this analysis
directory_tree_____outputs <- list(
    "filepath_____outputs_____processed_data" = 
        file.path("outputs", "processed_data"),
    "filepath_____outputs_____harm_on_population_health_____figures" =

# 6 DATA PROCESSING {#ind-6--DATA-PROCESSING}  
***  

The data processing pipeline, started with a supplied file,
[*repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2*
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
that contained raw data from the 
[*Storm Events Dataset*](#ind-4--STORM-EVENTS-DATASET)
and produced the [table with the processed data](#ind-7--PROCESSED-DATA).  

The pipeline consists of seven distinct stages:  

  1. [**Load The Raw Data In R**](#ind-6-1--Load-The-Raw-Data-In_R)  
     * The table with the raw data was created 
     by loading in R the raw data from the supplied file 
     with the compressed raw data with all variables coerced to character type. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the raw data was presented.  
  2. [**Preprocess The Raw Data**](#ind-6-2--Preprocess-The-Raw-Data)  
     * From the data at the table with the raw data, 
     in order to create the table with the preprocessed data 
     prerequisites were verified about the variables required for the analysis 
     before they were selected, coerced to their appropriate types 
     and a key was set for the table. Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the preprocessed data was presented.  
  3. [**6.3 Extract The Target Data Subset**](#ind-6-3--Extract-The-Target-Data-Subset)  
     * From the table with the preprocessed data only the subset of data 
     that includes the observations for the weather events 
     that happened in the period from 2001 to 2011 
     and caused non-zero fatalities, injuries, property damage or crop damage 
     were extracted. Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the target data subset was presented.  
  4. [**Conduct In-Record Data Validation**](#ind-6-4--Conduct-In-Record-Data-Validation)  
     * The values of each variable at the table with the target data subset 
     were validated against appropriate constrains for each column separately 
     (independently of the other variables) 
     and those entries that were found invalid got substituted with NAs 
     to create the table with the in-record validated data. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the in-record validated data was presented.  
  5. [**Impute Missing Values**](#ind-6-5--Impute-Missing-Values)  
     * The missing values at each variable 
     from the table with the in-record validated data were examined 
     and the those that could be retrieved 
     (via a deterministic and conservative way) were imputed,
     to produce the table with the imputed data. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the imputed data was presented.  
  6. [**Conduct Cross-Record Data Validation**](#ind-6-6--Conduct-Cross-Record-Data-Validation)  
     * Each observations from the table with the imputed data 
     was validated against appropriate constrains 
     that spanned across all available variables 
     and only those that were found valid
     were used to create the table with the cross-record validated data. 
     Post validation was conducted and 
     an overview of the table with the cross-record validated data was presented.  
  7. [**6.7 Produce The Processed Data**](#ind-6-7--Produce-The-Processed-Data)  
     * From the table with the cross-record validated data, 
     by transforming appropriately the available information,
     the table with the processed data was created 
     that contained the variables required 
     to identify the most harmful weather event types 
     with respect to the population health and for the economy. 
     Post validation was conducted.  

At each stage of the data processing procedure 
any fact that played a major role 
was highlighted and examined when it was needed, 
in compliance with the spirit of the assignment, 
aiming to supply all the facts necessary to understand how and why 
the decision making behind this analysis happened 
in order to create a well justified and documented, reproducible report.

### 6.1.1 Create the table with the raw data {#ind-6-1-1--Create-the-table-with-the-raw-data}  

The raw data was loaded in R directly from the supplied file 
[repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
(which was a CSV file, compressed via a bzip2 algorithm),
with all variables deliberately coerced to character type 
in order to ensure that no information was lost or altered 
as a side effect of coercion. 
The first row of the file includes headers that were used 
to automatically assign the names of all the variables 
at the table with the raw data that was created.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Load the raw data in R from the supplied file:
#     "repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2"
# and create the table with the raw data.
raw_data <- fread(
  ## the file is expected to exist at the working directory
  file = filepath_____unprocessed_data,
  ## the variables in the file are separated via a comma
  sep = ",",
  ## the first row of the file contains the names of the variables
  header = TRUE,
  ## all variables were deliberately loaded as character type
  ## to avoid any loss or alteration of information as a side effect of coercion
  colClasses = "character"
)

```

### 6.1.2 Conduct post validation for the table with the raw data {#ind-6-1-2--Conduct-post-validation-for-the-table-with-the-raw-data}  

The table with the raw data was post validated to ensure 
that the data from the file was loaded in R correctly.  
Three simple constrains were applied:  

   1. It should contain 37 variables.  
   2. It should contain 902297 observations.  
   3. The type of all variables should be 'character'.  

*(The expected number of variables and the expected number of observations, 
were acquired interactively before the execution of the main script 
[RepRes_analysis.Rmd
](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/blob/master/RepRes_analysis.Rmd) 
and were then used to form the constrains for the post validation.)*

```{r conduct_post_validation_for_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Create a validator with constrains for the validity of loaded raw data. 
V_____loaded_raw_data <- validator(
  ## create a character vector that captures the class of each variable
  classes_of_varirables := vapply(
    X = ., 
    ### although it is not expected to get an output 
    ### with more than one element for the class of each variable, 
    ### in general it is possible to happen, 
    ### so proper care is taken to collapse the elements of such vector 
    ### in a single element so that the vapply() function 
    ### won't fail with an error in such case
    FUN = function(x) paste(class(x), collapse = ","), 
    FUN.VALUE = character(1)
  ),
  "expected_number_of_variables" = ( length(.) == 37 ),
  "expected_number_of_observations" = ( nrow(.) == 902297 ),
  "expected_variable_types" = ( classes_of_varirables == "character" )
)

# Confront the table with the raw data with the validator
# which constrains the constrains for the validity of raw data.
CF_____loaded_raw_data <- confront(dat = raw_data, V_____loaded_raw_data)

```

The table with the raw data was valid.  

```{r create_a_kable_with_the_results_from_post_validation_of_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Create a kable with the results of post validation 
# for the table with the raw data. 
kable(
  x = summary(CF_____loaded_raw_data)[
    , 
    c("name", "items", "passes", "fails", "nNA", "error", "warning")
    ], 
  caption = paste0(

### 6.1.3 Overview of the table with the raw data {#ind-6-1-3--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-raw-data}  

The table with the raw data 
contained 37 variables that were all of type 'character' 
and 902297 observations.

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Print the structure of the table with the raw data.
str(raw_data)

```

There were no missing values (coded as NAs) 
at any of the variables it contained, 
but there were a lot of empty values 
which probably represent missing values. 
For some of the variables, 
a suspiciously large or small number of distinct values was observed.  

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_facts_for_the_table_with_the_raw_data}

# Create a kable to highlight some facts 
# about the variables at the table with the raw data.
kable(
  data.table(
    "Variable" = names(raw_data),
    "Number of Distinct Values" = vapply(
      X = raw_data, 
      FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)), 
      FUN.VALUE = integer(1)
      ),
    "Number of NAs" = vapply(
      X = raw_data, 
      FUN = function(x) sum(is.na(x)),
      FUN.VALUE = integer(1)
      ),
    # from the output with the structure of the table with the raw data 
    # it was found that some empty values exist at some variables 
    # and the exact number that each of them contains was reported
    "Number of Empty Values" = vapply(
      X = raw_data, 
      FUN = function(x) sum(x == ""), 
      FUN.VALUE = integer(1))
    
  ),
  caption = paste0(
    "TABLE 6.1.3-2: ", 
    "Facts about the variables at the table with the raw data."
  )
) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c(

    ), 
    full_width = FALSE,

## 6.2 Preprocess The Raw Data {#ind-6-2--Preprocess-The-Raw-Data}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

From the table with the raw data which contains 37 variables, 
only 9 were selected to create the table with preprocessed data 
and proceed with this analysis:  

  1. **REFNUM** : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **BGN_DATE** : the date when each weather event begun  
  3. **EVTYPE** : the type of each weather event  
  4. **FATALITIES** : the number of fatalities  
  5. **INJURIES** : the number of injuries  
  6. **PROPDMG** : the magnitude value of the damage caused in properties 
  that could have been expressed in thousands, millions or billions of dollars, 
  depending on the corresponding indicator value at the variable *PROPDMGEXP*  
  7. **PROPDMGEXP** : an indicator value that denotes 
  whether the corresponding magnitude value at the variable *PROPDMG*
  refers to thousands, millions or billions of dollars  
  8. **CROPDMG** : the magnitude value of the damage caused in crops 
  that could have been expressed in thousands, millions or billions of dollars, 
  depending on the corresponding indicator value at the variable *CROPDMGEXP*  
  9. **CROPDMGEXP** : an indicator value that denotes 
  whether the corresponding magnitude value at the variable *CROPDMG*
  refers to thousands, millions or billions of dollars  

Due to the fact that all variables at the table with the raw data 
were (deliberately) loaded as type 'character' 
some prerequisites were needed to get verified 
for the format of the character string values that they contained
before they were coerced to their appropriate type.   

The variable *REFNUM* after having verified 
that the values it contained uniquely identify each observation, 
was set as the key for the table with the preprocessed data. 

Finally post validation was conducted 
and some facts about the table with the preprocessed data were highlighted.

### 6.2.1 Verify the prerequisites for the selected variables {#ind-6-2-1--Verify-the-prerequisites-for-the-selected-variables}  

Two key points were checked for the values of the selected variables 
from the table with raw data before proceeding 
to create the table with the preprocessed data:  

* [6.2.1.1 Verify the coercibility of the values for the selected variables
](#ind-6-2-1-1--Verify-the-coercibility-for-the-values-at-the-selected-variables)  
  * Checks if the format of the character string values

  are compatible with the (variable) type 
  that each of them should be coerced to.  
* [6.2.1.2 Verify the uniqueness of the key values
](#ind-6-2-1-2--Verify-the-uniqueness-of-the-key-values)  
  * Checked if the values of the variable *REFNUM* 
  (when coerced to type 'integer')
  that was intended to be used as the key 
  of the table preprocessed data 
  uniquely identifies each observation.

#### 6.2.1.1 Verify the coercibility of the values for the selected variables {#ind-6-2-1-1--Verify-the-coercibility-for-the-values-at-the-selected-variables}  

The format of the character string values of the selected variables, 
*REFNUM*, *BGN_DATE*, *EVTYPE*, *FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, 
*PROPDMG*, *PROPDMGEXP*, *CROPDMG* and *CROPDMGEXP*, 
from the table with the raw data were checked in order to verify that 
they were compatible with the new variable type 
that each them should be coerced to, 
so as not to lose any information without knowing it 
(or in other words to avoid the side effect of automatic substitution by NAs, 
of the values that were incompatible 
with the new variable type that each of them should be coerced to).  

The variables *EVTYPE*, *BGN_DATE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP* 
were already in their appropriate type (which is 'character'),
so no further adjustments were needed. 
On the other hand the variables *REFNUM*, *FATALITIES* and *INJURIES*

#### 6.2.1.2 Verify the uniqueness of the key values {#ind-6-2-1-2--Verify-the-uniqueness-of-the-key-values}  

The variable *REFNUM*, coerced to its proper type (that is 'integer'),
should and was expected to uniquely identify each observation, 
making it an excellent choice 
for the key of the table with the preprocessed data, 
(as well as for the rest of the tables that were generated 
at the following stages of the data processing pipeline).  

Before proceeding to set the *REFNUM* as the key, 
the claim that *it uniquely identifies each observations* 
was checked to avoid unexpected surprises 
that may jeopardize the reproducibility of the analysis.  

```{r verify_the_uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_variable}

# Create a validator for the uniqueness of values at the variable REFNUM.
V_____uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_of_the_table <- validator(
  "value_uniquely_identifies_the_observation" = (
    # the values of the variable REFNUM will be first coerced 
    # to their appropriate variable type, which is 'integer' 
    # and then checked for uniqueness
    as.integer(REFNUM) %in% 
      names(table(as.integer(REFNUM)))[table(as.integer(REFNUM)) == 1]
  )
)

# Confront the table with raw data with the validator 
# for the uniqueness of values at REFNUM variable 
CF_____uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_of_the_table <- confront(
  dat = raw_data,
  V_____uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_of_the_table
)

```

All values of the variable *REFNUM* were found to be distinct,
and consequently they uniquely identify each observation.  

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_the_results_for_the_uniqueness_of_values_for_the_key_variable}

### 6.2.2 Create the table with the preprocessed data {#ind-6-2-2--Create-the-table-with-the-preprocessed-data}  

Having identify the variables from the table with the raw data 
(*REFNUM*, *BGN_DATE*, *EVTYPE*, *FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, 
*PROPDMG*, *PROPDMGEXP*, *CROPDMG* and *CROPDMGEXP*) 
that were required to proceed with the analysis, 
and [verified that they satisfied the necessary prerequisites
](#ind-6-2-1--Verify-the-prerequisites-for-the-selected-variables), 
the table with preprocessed data was created,
by selecting those 9 variables, 
coercing them to their appropriate type:  

1. *REFNUM* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'integer'  
2. *BGN_DATE* was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  
3. *EVTYPE* was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  
4. *FATALITIES* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'integer'  
5. *INJURIES* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'integer'  
6. *PROPDMG* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'double'  
7. *PROPDMGEXP*  was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  
8. *CROPDMG* was selected and coerced from 'character' type to 'double'  
9. *CROPDMGEXP*  was selected 
(no coercion happened as it was already of the proper type, 'character')  

and finally setting the variable *REFNUM* as the key of the table.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_preprocessed_data}

# Create the table with the preprocessed data 
# with the selected variables from the table with the raw data, 
# coerced to their appropriate type.

  2. all the observations from table with raw data were transfered  
  3. each of the selected variables was coerced to its appropriate type  
  4. no missing values were introduced as a result of the coercion  
  5. *REFNUM* was set as the key of the table

## 6.3 Extract The Target Data Subset {#ind-6-3--Extract-The-Target-Data-Subset}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

From all available observations 
that the table with the preprocessed data contains, 
only the subset of the weather phenomena 
that begun at 2001 or later 
and resulted in non-zero harm either to population health 
(caused fatalities or injuries) 
or to economy (caused property damage or crop damage) 
will be used for this analysis (for the reasons that were discussed in detail 
at the section [4.2 Points Of Interest](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest) 
about the *Storm Events Dataset*).  

The consistency of the format of dates at the *BGN_DATE* variable 
(that indicates when each weather phenomenon begun)
was checked, as it was intended to be used for the identification,
the eligible observations for the target data subset were identified, 
and got extracted to create the table with the target data subset.  

Finally post validation was conducted 
and some facts about the table with the target data subset were highlighted.

### 6.3.1 Identify the target subset of observations {#ind-6-3-1--Identify-the-target-subset-of-observations}  

Out of all available observations it was decided to use for the analysis 
the subset that includes only the weather phenomena 
that happened from 2001 and later (due to the implications of 
[changes in the composition of weather event types
](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)) 
and resulted in non-zero harm either to population health 
(caused fatalities or injuries) or to economy 
(caused property damage or crop damage) (due to the implications of the 
[eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset
](#ind-4-2-2--Eligibility-criteria-for-inclusion-of-weather-events-in-the-dataset)).  

The format of the date values at *BGN_DATE* variable 
from the table with preprocessed data 
had to be checked to see if it is consistent across all observations, 
before it was used to form the first of the two constrains. 

The eligible observations were finally identified by their key value 
(denoted by the variable *REFNUM*).  

* [6.3.1.1 Verify the consistency of date format
](#ind-6-3-1-1--Verify-the-consistency-of-date-format`)  
  * Verifies that the character string format of the values 
    at *BGN_DATE* variable are consistent. 
* [6.3.1.2 Identify the eligible observations
](#ind-6-3-1-2--Identify-the-eligible-observations)  
  * Identifies by their key value 
  the observations at the table with preprocessed data 
  that begun from 2001 or later and resulted in non-zero harm 
  either to population health (caused fatalities or injuries) 
  or to economy (caused property damage or crop damage)

#### 6.3.1.1 Verify the consistency of date format {#ind-6-3-1-1--Verify-the-consistency-of-date-format}  

The year in the value of date at the variable *BGN_DATE* 
was intended to be used as one of the two criteria to 
identify the eligible observations for the target data subset at the 
[next subsubsection](#ind-6-3-1-2--Identify-the-eligible-observations).  

That's why it is crucial at this point, 
to verify that the values of date are in the expected format, 
which as indicated by the [overview of the table with preprocessed data
](#ind-6-2-4--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-preprocessed-data) 
(as well as some interactive examination) seems to be:  

* **MM/DD/YYYY 0:00:00**
  * *MM* stands for 2 characters for the month  
  * *DD* stands for 2 characters for the day  
  * *YYYY* stands for 4 characters for the year  
  * the value of year is followed by a space  
  * *0:00:00* is a dummy part that stands for the time  

```{r verify_the_consistency_of_format_for_the_values_of_begin_date}

# Create a validator for the format 
# of the character string values of the dates.
V____expected_character_string_format_for_begin_date <- validator(

CF____expected_character_string_format_for_begin_date <- confront(

Indeed all values for dates were found to be in the expected format.

According to the discussion for the two 
[points of interest for the Storm Events Dataset](#ind-4-2--Points-Of-Interest) 
only a subset of observations will be used for this analysis. 
This target data subset includes only the observations which refer to 
weather phenomena that simultaneously satisfy the following two criteria:  

* **begun at Jan 2011 and later** due to the implications of 
  [changes in the composition of weather event types
  ](#ind-4-2-1--Changes-in-the-composition-of-weather-event-types)  
  * the year (that was extracted from the date value of the *BGN_DATE* variable  
  coerced to integer) must be found equal or larger than 2001  
* **resulted in non-zero harm either to population health (caused fatalities or injuries) 
or to economy (caused property damage or crop damage)** due to the implications of the 
[eligibility criteria for inclusion of weather events in the dataset

Out of 902297 observation from the table with preprocessed data, 
there were found:  

* 488692 observations which refer to weather phenomena 
that begun at 2001 or later  
* 254633 observations which refer to weather phenomena that resulted in 
non-zero harm either to population health (caused fatalities or injuries) 
or to economy (caused property damage or crop damage)

The observations that satisfied simultaneously the two criteria

## 6.4 Conduct In-Record Data Validation {#ind-6-4--Conduct-In-Record-Data-Validation}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

Through the in-record data validation stage
the values of each variable from the table with the target data subset 
were examined independently of the corresponding values at other variables, 
in order to identify invalid entries 
which were then substituted by missing values (coded properly as NA)
to create the table with the in-record validated data.  

Finally post validation was conducted 
and some facts about the table with the in-record validated data 
were highlighted.

### 6.4.2 Conduct in-record data validation for each variable {#ind-6-4-2--Conduct-in-record-data-validation-for-each-variable}  

To create the constrains for the in-record validation for each variable 
from the table with the target data subset, some 'common world knowledge' 
combined with information provided by the *Storm Data Documentation* 
about the [valid values of the available variables
](#ind-6-4-1--Introduce-information-from-the-Strom-Data-Documentation) 
were used.  

Specifically:  

1. The *REFNUM* variable's values must be unique for each observations.  
2. the *BGN_DATE* variable's value must contain a year part that is from 2001 up to 2011
3. The *EVTYPE* variable's values must be one of the 
[48 defined events types](#ind-6-4-1-1--Valid-values-for-the-EVTYPE-variable).  
4. The *FATALITIES* variable's values must be non-negative.  
5. The *INJURIES* variable's values must be non-negative. 
6. The *PROPDMG* variable's values must be non-negative.  
7. The *PROPDMGEXP* variable's values must be *K*, *M* or *B*.  
8. The *CROPDMG* variable's values must be non negative.  
9. The *CROPDMGEXP* variable's values must be *K*, *M* or *B*.

Although unnecessary to test the constrains for all variables,
that were included in the table with the target data subset 
(the uniqueness of the values in key variable *REFNUM*,
the fact the year indicated in the *BGN_DATE* variable was from 2001 to 2011 
as well as the fact that the values of the variables 
*FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, *CROPDMG*, *PROPDMG* were non-negative), 
because some of them had been verified 
in previous stages of the data processing procedure,
such tests were included in order to provided a detailed and complete 
overview of all the in-record constrains for the entries  
of each variable at the validated data table.  

Actually only the variables *EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP* 
needed to be validated in this stage, 
as these were the ones that haven't been checked properly yet.  

```{r conduct_in_record_validation_for_the_variables_at_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset}

### 6.4.5 Overview of the table with the in-record validated data {#ind-6-4-5--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-in-record-validated-data}  

The table with the in-record validated data contained 9 variables 
and 144826 observations.  

The variable *REFNUM* was set as the key of table.

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_in_record_validated_data}

# Print the structure of the table with the in-record validated data table .
str(in_record_validated_data)

```

There were plenty of missing values, 
that were introduced as a result of the in-record validation procedure
for the variables *EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP*, 
but the number of distinct values didn't indicate any more 
the presence of obvious abnormalities.

## 6.5 Impute Missing Values {#ind-6-5--Impute-Missing-Values}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

In this stage of data processing procedure,
an attempt was made to maximize 
the amount of available information for the analysis,
by imputing some of the missing values 
that exist at the table with the in-record validated data 
with plausible values.

There were 3 variables (*EVTYPE*, *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP*) 
that contained NAs, all of which were introduced through the 
[in-record data validation stage](#ind-6-4--Conduct-In-Record-Data-Validation). 

Via a conservative deterministic approach 
which aimed to retrieve the missing values 
only for the cases that there were almost no doubt 
about the values that were imputed,
the majority of those entries got successfully restored.

However it is highlighted that for the variable *EVTYPE*, 
there is no guarantee that the values imputed are error-free, 
due to the fact that the associations were made based on the invalid values 
found at the table with the target data subset, 
that were substituted by NAs and the information available in 
[NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)
(at chapter 7)*  
by the analyst who has **no expertise neither on weather nor in meteorology**. 

On the other hand, the missing values that were imputed 
for the variables *PROPDMGEXP* and *CROPDMGEXP* 
are almost certainly correct 
(and even if they are not,
it didn't affect in any significant way the results of the analysis 
as they all correspond to observations 
that resulted in 0 property and crop damage respectively 
while the analysis focused on the observations for the weather events 
that caused non-zero harm).  

```{r create_a_dummy_table_for_imputed_data_as_a_copy_of_the_table_with_in_record_validated_data} 

# Create a dummy table by coping the table with the in-record validated data 
# at which the missing values for the variable EVTYPE, PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP 
# will be imputed to get the table with the imputed data.
imputed_data <- copy(in_record_validated_data)

#### 6.5.1.1 Examine the invalid values from the variable EVTYPE {#ind-6-5-1-1--Examine-the-invalid-values-from-the-variable-EVTYPE}  

For the variable *EVTYPE* at the table with the in-record validated data, 
out of the total 144826 observations 32775 (22.63%) were NAs.

These 32775 missing values at the table with the in-record validated data,

#### 6.5.1.2 Associate plausible substitutions to the invalid values from the variable EVTYPE {#ind-6-5-1-2--Associate-plausible-substitutions-to-the-invalid-values-from-the-variable-EVTYPE}

To impute the corresponding NAs associations were made 
from the invalid entries to defined weather event types.  

* Some of the associations were based solely on the invalid values,
which directly corresponded to defined event types 
as they seem to be either typos 
(e.g. "RIP CURRENTS" instead of "RIP CURRENT") 
or acronyms of the expected values 
(e.g. "TSTM WIND" instead of "THUNDERSTORM WIND").  
* While for others the description for each one of the 48 event types 
that was available in 
[NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)
*(at chapter 7)* was taken into account 
for cases where a variation of the defined value had been supplied 
(e.g. "URBAN/SML STREAM FLD" instead of "HEAVY RAIN").  

**Nevertheless it is stressed 
that the associations mainly depend on 'common sense' judgment 
(instead of solid professional expertise)
and in no way they are guaranteed to be error-free,
despite the best efforts made to impute only the most obvious cases.**  

In total, 28 distinct invalid values were associated 
to some of the 48 defined weather event types:

### 6.6.1 Identify all valid observations {#ind-6-6-1--Identify-all-valid-observations}  

A single constrain that spanned across all available variables 
at the table with the imputed data was created and used 
to identify the valid observations.  

Specifically, each observation must simultaneous satisfy the 4 criteria below 
in order to be considered valid:  
  
  1. The id must be unique (and non-missing).  
  2. The weather event type value must be 
  one of the defined weather events (and non-missing).  
  3. The year must be in the period from 2001 to 2011 (and non-missing).  
  4. There must be non-zero harm either to population health or to economy, so:
     * either fatalities must be positive (and non-missing), 
     * or injuries must be positive (and non-missing), 
     * or property damage (in dollars) must be retrievable and positive (and non-missing), 
     * or crop damage (in dollars) must be retrievable and positive (and non-missing).  

```{r conduct_cross_record_validation_for_the_observations_at_table_with_the_imputed_data}

# A validator was created that contains a constrain 
# for the validity of each observation 
# that spans across all variables .

      ( as.integer(str_extract(BGN_DATE, "(?<=^\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/)\\d{4}(?= 0:00:00$)")) %in%
          c(2001:2011) ) &
      (
        ( FATALITIES > 0 ) |
          ( INJURIES > 0 ) |

# the observations that contain valid values across all variables. 
CF_____cross_record_constrains <- confront(
  dat = imputed_data,
  V_____cross_record_constrains
)

```

Out of the total of 144826 observation at the table with the imputed data 
144571 were valid across all variables while only 255 were found to be invalid.

```{r create_a_kable_with_the_results_of_cross_record_validation_for_the_observations_at_the_table_with_the_imputed_data}

  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), 
    full_width = FALSE,
    fixed_thead = TRUE
  )

```

The value of the key (denoted by the variable *REFNUM*) 
was used to identify the observations that were valid. 

```{r identify_the_cross_record_valid_observation_at_the_table_with_the_imputed_data_by_their_key_value}

### 6.6.4 Overview of the table with the cross-record validated data {#ind-6-6-4--Overview-of-the-table-with-the-cross-record-validated-data}

The table with the cross-validated data contained 9 variables and 144571 observations.  

The variable *REFNUM* was set as the key of this table.  

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_cross_record_validated_data}

# Print the structure of the table with the cross-record validated data.
str(cross_validated_data)

```

All the observation at the table with the cross-validated data are complete 
as indicated by the results of 
[post validation for the table with cross-validated data

### 6.7.1 Create the table with the processed data {#ind-6-7-1--Create-the-table-with-the-processed-data}  

The following transformations were applied 
at the variables from the table with the cross-record validated data, 
in order to construct the table with the processed data: 
  
  1. the variable **REFNUM** was transfered unchanged  
  2. the variable *BGN_DATE* was omitted  
  3. the variable *EVTYPE* was transfered and renamed to **EVENT_TYPE**  
  4. the variable **FATALITIES** was transfered unchanged  
  5. the variable **INJURIES** was transfered unchanged  
  6. the variables *FATALITIES* and *INJURIES* were added  
  in order to create the variable **CASUALTIES**  
  7. the variables *PROPDMG* (that denoted the magnitude of property damage) 
  and *PROPDMGEXP* (that indicated if the value of *PROPDMG* referred to 
  thousands, millions or billions)
  were combined appropriately to retrieve the property damage in dollars 
  in order to create the variable **PROPERTY_DAMAGE**  
  8. the variables *CROPDMG* (that denoted the magnitude of crop damage) 
  and *CROPDMGEXP* (that indicated if the value of *CROPDMG* referred to 
  thousands, millions or billions)
  were combined appropriately to retrieve the crop damage in dollars 
  in order to create the variable **CROP_DAMAGE**  
  9. the variables *PROPERTY_DAMAGE* and *CROP_DAMAGE* were added 
  in order to create the variable **ECONOMIC_DAMAGE**

### 6.7.2 Conduct post validation for the table with the processed data {#ind-6-7-2--Conduct-post-validation-for-the-table-with-the-processed-data}  

Post validation was conducted to verify that all observations 
contained at the table with the processed data were valid 
across all variables it contained.  

One constrain was created and used, which consists of three parts 
that must hold simultaneous for each observation:  
  
  * The key for each observation denoted by the variable *REFNUM* must be unique.  
  * The event type for each observation denoted by the variable *EVENT_TYPE* 
  must be one of 48 defined weather event types according to the 
  *NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-1605, AUGUST 17, 2007 (at chapter 7)*  
  * At least one of the six variables that indicate the harm 
  (either to population health or to economy), 
  denoted by the variables *FATALITIES*, *INJURIES*, *CASUALTIES*, 
  *PROPERTY_DAMAGE*, *CROP_DAMAGE* or *EC0NOMIC_DAMAGE* must be positive.  

```{r conduct_post_validation_for_the_table_with_the_processed_data}

# Create a validator that contains a constrain 
# that spans across all variables contained 
# at the table with the processed data 
# for each observation it includes.
V_____post_validation_of_table_with_the_processed_data <- validator(
  "valid_observation" = (
    ( REFNUM %in% table(REFNUM)[names(table(REFNUM)[table(REFNUM) == 1])] ) &
      ( EVENT_TYPE %in% defined_event_types ) &
      ( FATALITIES > 0 ) |
      ( INJURIES > 0 ) |
      ( CASUALTIES > 0) |
      ( PROPERTY_DAMAGE > 0 ) |
      ( CROP_DAMAGE > 0) |
      ( ECONOMIC_DAMAGE > 0 )
  )
)

# Confront the table with the processed data with

# across all variables.
CF_____post_validation_of_table_with_the_processed_data <- confront(
  dat = processed_data,

All the 144571 observations included in the processed data table 
were found to satisfy the condition.

# 8 HARM ON POPULATION HEALTH {#ind-8--HARM-ON-POPULATION-HEALTH}  
***  

In this chapter an attempt was made to quantify the harm on population health 
based on the information from the 
[table with the processed data](#ind-7--PROCESSED-DATA).  

The harm on population health was examined over three perspectives:  
  
  1. [The harm on population health with respect to fatalities 
  caused by each weather event type 
  based on the observations for weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero fatalities 
  at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011.
  ](#ind-8-1--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Fatalities-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)  
  2. [The harm on population health with respect to injuries 
  caused by each weather event type 
  based on the observations for weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero injuries 
  at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011.
  ](#ind-8-2--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Injuries-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)  
  3. [The harm on population health with respect to casualties 
  (sum of fatalities and injuries) caused by each weather event type
  based on the observations for weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero casualties 
  at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011.
  ](#ind-8-3--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Casualties-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)  

The weather event types for which less 
than 10 observations that resulted in non-zero harm were available 
with respect to a perspective of interest were ommitted 
(from the analysis of that particular perspective),
to avoid highly misleading statistics. 
Consequently the subset of weather event types 
that were included for each of the three perspectives is different. 

Due to the fact that for all perspectives 
the values of interest for the observations 
of most weather event types were highly positively skewed, 
it was consider important in order to obtain an insightful picture 
of their consequences to examine them over three different aspects: 

  1. The **overall** harm on population health 
  caused by each weather event type.  
  2. The harm on population health caused by 
  **the 90% of cases with the lowest impact** 
  of each weather event type.  
  3. The harm on population health caused by 
  **the 10% of cases with the highest impact** 
  of each weather event type.  

For every aspect the sample size, the skewness and the mean 
of the values that encapsulated the harm with respect to each perspective 
were summarized by each weather event type and reported.

The results obtained for the harm on population health 
by each weather event type were presented at the section 
[10.1 Question 1: Across the United States, 
which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) 
are most harmful with respect to population health?
](#ind-10-1--results-harm-on-population-health) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS)).  

For each of the three perspectives that were examined 
for the harm on population health by each weather event type 
a multiplot was created to visualize the respective results. 
Those multiplots constitute the three parts of the *Figure 1*, 
which was composed and presented at the subsection 
[10.1.1 Overview of results for the harm on population health
](#ind-10-1-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-population-health) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS)).

(*In compliance with the restrictions of the assignment, 
according to which at least 1 but no more than 3 figures 
should be included in the report, 
the Multiplot as well as the elementary plots that contain 
were NOT displayed separately and can ONLY be examined 
as PARTs of the Figure 1 at the subsection 
[10.1.1 Overview of results for the harm on population health
](#ind-10-1-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-population-health) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).)*

## 8.1 Harm On Population Health With Respect To Fatalities By Each Weather Event Type {#ind-8-1--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Fatalities-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

The required variables and the target data subset of observations 
for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities were extracted 
from the table with the processed data, and processed 
to create a new variable that divided the observations 
for each of the included weather event types to two supplementary groups:  

* the 90% of observations with the lowest impact  
* the 10% of observations with the highest impact  
  
before the information for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities was summarized by each weather event type.  

Three aspects were examined: 
  
  1. The overall average number of fatalities by each weather event type.  
  2. The average number of fatalities by each weather event type 
  for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact.  
  3. The average number of fatalities by each weather event type 
  for the 10% of cases with the highest impact.  

For each aspect, the average number of fatalities 
by each weather event type, the number of its
available observations (based on which the average was computed) 
and their skewness were examined.  

The overall average number of fatalities was used as the main criterion 
to determine which weather events caused the most harm on population health
with respect to fatalities but it is important to take into account 
the other two aspect that were presented in order to obtain a more insightful 
and complete 'picture' of their consequences, 
(especially given the fact that for most of the weather event types, 
the fatalities were highly positively skewed).  

The table with results for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities by each weather event type 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.1.2 Most harmful event types with respect to fatalities
](#ind-10-1-2--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-fatalities) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).

Finally the *Multiplot 1.1* was created to visualize 
the results for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 1.1 nor the elementary plots 
that it contains were presented in this section 
due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment 
to include in the report at least 1 but no more than 3 figures.
It can be examined at the subsection 
[10.1.1 Overview of results for the harm on population health
](#ind-10-1-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-population-health)
at the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS), 
where the Figure 1 was presented, 
of which the Multiplot 1.1 constitutes the PART 1.)*

  * The target data subset of observations needed to evaluate

### 8.1.1 Extract the target data for harm on population health with respect to fatalities {#ind-8-1-1--Extract-the-target-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-fatalities}  

In order to examine the harm on population health with respect to fatalities 
caused by each weather event type, 
the variables *REFNUM*, *EVENT_TYPE* and *FATALITIES* 
were selected from the table with the processed data and 
**only the observations that refer to weather events 
that resulted in non-zero fatalities** were extracted. 

Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid highly misleading statistics 
due to the small number of observations for some of the weather event types, 
a lowest bound of 10 weather events that caused non zero fatalities 
(for each of the included weather event types)
was selected (subjectively by the analyst) and applied. 

This lowest bound, although it may seem (and generally it is) not enough 
to get trustworthy statistics, it was considered to be *"good enough"* 
taking into account that : 
  
  1. the analysis focuses in describing historical data 
  without trying to make inferences 
  that would demand substantially bigger samples, 
  although any statistic based on less than 10 observations 
  could not be taken seriously 
  especially in cases (such as in this analysis) where the distribution 
  of fatalities for each weather event type was skewed.
  2. a period of 10 years (from 2001 to 2011) 
  in which the observations that were used in the analysis occurred, 
  is relatively small time to produce big samples of weather events 
  that caused non zero fatalities for some the weather event types. 
  Thus, if a highest bound was selected to get more robust statistics 
  such as samples of 100 or 300, the majority of weather event types 
  would have been excluded, making the results of the analysis trivial.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_fatalities}

# Extract the required variables and the target data subset of observations 
# for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities.
target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____fatalities <- processed_data[
  ## Extract only the observations that have resulted in non-zero fatalities.
  FATALITIES > 0,
  ## Select only the relevant variables. 
  list(REFNUM, EVENT_TYPE, FATALITIES)
  ][
    ### Keep only the observations that correspond to the weather event types 
    ### for which there are at least 10 weather events available.
    EVENT_TYPE %in% 
      names(table(EVENT_TYPE)[table(EVENT_TYPE) >= 10])
    ]

```

The table with the target data for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities consist of 3175 observations. 

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_fatalities} 

# Print the structure of the table with the target data subset 
# for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities.
str(target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____fatalities)

```

The variable *EVENT_TYPE* includes 26 distinct weather event types, 
for most of which the variable *FATALITIES* was highly positively skewed. 

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_some_facts_for_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_fatalities}

# Create a kable to present some facts about the table with the target data 
# for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities.
kable(
  x = target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____fatalities[
    order(EVENT_TYPE), 
    list(
      "N" = .N, 
      "SKEWNESS" = round(skewness(FATALITIES), 4)
    ), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
    ],
  caption = paste0(
    "Table 8.1.1-1: ",
    "Facts about the table with the target data subset of observations ", 
    "for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities."
  )
) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c(
      "striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", "bordered"
    ), 
    full_width = FALSE,
    fixed_thead = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  footnote(
    general = "The skewness was rounded to 4 decimal places."
  )

```

It was worth noting that for the weather event types 
with highest number of observations 
there was highest skewness for the values of fatalities, 
indicating that the corresponding distribution of fatalities
has a heavy tail that wasn't possible to be observed 
when few observation were available.

### 8.1.2 Process the target data for harm on population health with respect to fatalities {#ind-8-1-2--Process-the-target-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-fatalities}  

To create the table with the processed data 
for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities 
from the corresponding target data subset for this perspective,
a new variable was created that divides the observations 
for each of the included weather event types in two complementary levels: 

* one that contains the 90% of cases with lowest impact  
* the other that contains the 10% of cases with highest impact  

This decision was made due to the high skewness that was observed 
for the values of the variable *FATALITIES* for most weather event types, 
which indicates that the underlining distributions of such phenomena 
has a heavy tail that causes this heterogeneity on the observations. 
As a result a small number of fatalities were observed 
for the majority of cases that resulted in non-zero fatalities 
while in the few cases with the highest impact 
they caused lots of fatalities. 

Having in mind that the average number of fatalities 
will be used to determine which weather event types 
were the most harmful to population health (with respect to fatalities) 
combined with the fact that the average doesn't represent well 
the distribution of variables with high skewness, 
as it is highly affected by the most extreme values, 
it was considered necessary to examine the subsets 
created by those two levels in order to obtain an insightful picture. 


```{r create_the_table_with_the_processed_data_for_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_fatalities}

# Create the table with the processed data 
# for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities.
processed_data_____harm_on_population_health_____fatalities <- 
  target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____fatalities[

    ## Create a new variable divides the observations
    ## for each weather event into two supplementary groups:

    BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE := (function(x, p_bins) {
      
      # adds 0 and 1 in the vector supplied at the argument 'p_bins' 
      # to the start and the end respectively  
      # the supplied percentiles if they are missing 
      # and sort them ascending
      p_bins_increasing <- sort(c(0, p_bins, 1))
      
      # creates the character strings that labels of the bins by the values supplied at 
      # the argument 'p_bins' that will be the values of the new variable
      bin_labels <- paste0("(", p_bins_increasing[-length(p_bins_increasing)]*100,
                           "% - ", p_bins_increasing[-1]*100, "%]")
      
      # identify the number of occurrences that correspond to each label
      n_times <- vapply(2:length(p_bins_increasing),
                        function(i) {
                          as.integer(floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i]) -
                                       floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i - 1]))
                        }, integer(1))
      
      # multiply each label with the number of its occurrences
      x_bins_expanded <- rep(x = bin_labels, times = n_times)
      
      # order the label to much the values of the corresponding vector
      x_bins_expanded_reordered <- x_bins_expanded[order(seq_along(x)[order(x)])]
      
      ## Coerce the character vector with the labels of bins to a factor
      x_bins_factor <- factor(x_bins_expanded_reordered, labels = bin_labels, ordered = TRUE)
      
    })(FATALITIES, 0.9)
    , by = EVENT_TYPE
  ][
    ## Coerce the EVENT_VARIABLE to factor
    , EVENT_TYPE := as.factor(EVENT_TYPE) 
  ]

```

The table with the processed data for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities contains 4 variables:  

  1. **REFNUM** (int) : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **EVENT_TYPE** (Factor w/ 26 levels) : the type of each weather event
  3. **FATALITIES** (int) : the number of fatalities  
  4. **BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE** (Ord.factor w/ 2 levels) : 
  a factor that divides the observations for each 
  weather event type to two complementary levels, 
  one with the 90% of observations with the lowest impact and 
  another with the 10% of observations with the highest impact.

and 3175 observations.

### 8.1.3 Summarize the processed data for harm on population health with respect to fatalities by each weather event type {#ind-8-1-3--Summarize-the-processed-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-fatalities-by-each-weather-event-type}  

To evaluate the harm on population health by each weather event type 
with respect to fatalities a simplistic approach was adopted :  

  * the weather event types were ranked 
  from the most harmful to the least 
  based on the overall average number of fatalities 
  of the weather events that resulted in non-zero fatalities

The overall average number of fatalities caused by each weather event type 
was initially examined along with the skewness of the number of fatalities 
for each weather event type. In most cases the skewness was high 
(or even extremely high), so it was possible that the overall mean 
misrepresented the consequences of each weather event type.  

That is the reason why the average number of fatalities for 90% of weather events 
with the lowest impact versus the average number of fatalities for the 10% of 
weather events with the highest impact were also computed and examined.  

**It is highlighted that for the average number of fatalities 
that refers to the 10% of the cases that had the highest impact, 
there were few observations available for a lot of weather event types 
and the corresponding mean values should be interpreted with caution.**

The results of the table with the summary 
for the harm on population health with respect to fatalities
by each weather event type that was created in this section 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.1.2 Most harmful event types with respect to fatalities

of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS). 

The table with the summary for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities by each weather event type 
was exported (as an R file), in the folder of the working directory: 

* *outputs --> harm_on_population_health --> results* 

with filename:  

* *summary______harm_on_population_health______fatalities.R*

```{r exprot_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_fatalities}

##### **8.1.4.1.1 Create The Plot 1.1.1** {#ind-8-1-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-1-1-1}

The *Plot 1.1.1* displays 
**the overall average number of fatalities** 
caused by each weather event type taking into account 
all and only the observation that resulted in non-zero fatalities. 

The weather event types were matched with a number 
that represents the rank which was assigned to each of them 
from the most harmful to the least with respect to population health, 
based on the **overall average number of fatalities** they caused.  

The skewness of the number of fatalities 
for the observations of each weather event type
(based on which the overall number of fatalities was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

## 8.2 Harm On Population Health With Respect To Injuries By Each Weather Event Type {#ind-8-2--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Injuries-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

The required variables and the target data subset of observations 
for the harm on population health with respect to injuries 
were extracted from the table with the processed data, 
and processed to create a new variable that divided the observations 
for each of the included weather event types to two supplementary groups:  

* the 90% of observations with the lowest impact  
* the 10% of observations with the highest impact  
  
before the information for the harm on population health 
with respect to injuries was summarized by each weather event type.  

Three aspects were examined: 
  
  1. The overall average number of injuries by each weather event type.  
  2. The average number of injuries by each weather event type 
  for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact.  
  3. The average number of injuries by each weather event type 
  for the 10% of cases with the highest impact.  

For each aspect, the average number of injuries 
by each weather event type, the number of its
available observations (based on which the average was computed) 
and their skewness were examined. 

The overall average number of injuries was used as the main criterion 
to determine which weather events caused the most harm on population health
with respect to injuries but it is important to take into account 
the other two aspect that were presented in order to obtain a more insightful 
and complete 'picture' of their consequences, 
(especially given the fact that for most of the weather event types, 
the injuries were highly positively skewed).

The table with results for the harm on population health 
with respect to injuries by each weather event type 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.1.3 Most harmful event types with respect to injuries
](#ind-10-1-3--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-injuries) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).

Finally the *Multiplot 1.2* was created to visualize 
the results of the harm on population health with respect to injuries 
by each weather event type.

were presented in this section due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment

### 8.2.1 Extract the target data for harm on population health with respect to injuries {#ind-8-2-1--Extract-the-target-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-injuries}  

In order to examine the harm on population health with respect to injuries 
caused by each weather event type, 
the variables *REFNUM*, *EVENT_TYPE* and *INJURIES* 
were selected from the table with the processed data and 
**only the observations that refer to weather events 
that resulted in non-zero injuries** were extracted. 

Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid highly misleading statistics 
due to the small number of observations for some of the weather event types, 
a lowest bound of 10 weather events that caused non zero injuries 
(for each of the included weather event types)
was selected (subjectively by the analyst) and applied. 

This lowest bound, although it may seem (and generally it is) not enough 
to get trustworthy statistics, it was considered to be *"good enough"* 
taking into account that : 
  
  1. the analysis focuses in describing historical data 
  without trying to make inferences 
  that would demand substantially bigger samples, 
  although any statistic based on less than 10 observations 
  could not be taken seriously 
  especially in cases (such as in this analysis) where the distribution 
  of injuries for each weather event type was skewed.
  2. a period of 10 years (from 2001 to 2011) 
  in which the observations that were used in the analysis occurred, 
  is relatively small time to produce big samples of weather events 
  that caused non zero injuries for some the weather event types. 
  Thus, if a highest bound was selected to get more robust statistics 
  such as samples of 100 or 300, the majority of weather event types 
  would have been excluded, making the results of the analysis trivial.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_injuries}

# Extract the required variables and the target data subset of observations 
# for the harm on population health with respect to injuries.
target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____injuries <- processed_data[
  ## Extract only the observations that have resulted in non-zero injuries.
  INJURIES > 0,
  ## Select only the relevant variables. 
  list(REFNUM, EVENT_TYPE, INJURIES)
  ][
    ### Keep only the observations that correspond to the weather event types 
    ### for which there are at least 10 weather events available.
    EVENT_TYPE %in% 
      names(table(EVENT_TYPE)[table(EVENT_TYPE) >= 10])
    ]

```

The table with the target data for the harm on population health 
with respect to injuries consist of 5581 observations. 

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_injuries} 

# Print the structure of the table with the target data subset 
# for the harm on population health with respect to injuries.
str(target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____injuries)

```

The variable *EVENT_TYPE* includes 27 distinct weather event types, 
for most of which the variable *INJURIES* was highly positively skewed. 

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_some_facts_for_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_injuries}

# Create a kable to present some facts about the table with the target data 
# for the harm on population health with respect to injuries.
kable(
  x = target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____injuries[
    order(EVENT_TYPE), 
    list(
      "N" = .N, 
      "SKEWNESS" = round(skewness(INJURIES), 4)
    ), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
    ],
  caption = paste0(
    "Table 8.2.1-1: ",
    "Facts about the table with the target data subset of observations ", 
    "for the harm on population health with respect to injuries."
  )
) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), 
    full_width = FALSE,
    fixed_thead = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  footnote(
    general = "The skewness was rounded to 4 decimal places."
  )

```

It was worth noting that for the weather event types 
with highest number of observations 
there was highest skewness for the values of injuries, 
indicating that the corresponding distribution of injuries
has a heavy tail that wasn't possible to be observed 
when few observation were available.

### 8.2.2 Process the target data for harm on population health with respect to injuries {#ind-8-2-2--Process-the-target-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-injuries}  

To create the table with the processed data 
for the harm on population health with respect to injuries 
from the corresponding target data subset for this perspective,
a new variable was created that divides the observations 
for each of the included weather event types in two complementary levels: 

* one that contains the 90% of cases with lowest impact  
* the other that contains the 10% of cases with highest impact  

This decision was made due to the high skewness that was observed 
for the values of the variable *INJURIES* for most weather event types, 
which indicates that the underlining distributions of such phenomena 
has a heavy tail that causes this heterogeneity on the observations. 
As a result a small number of injuries were observed 
for the majority of cases that resulted in non-zero injuries 
while in the few cases with the highest impact 
they caused lots of injuries. 

Having in mind that the average number of injuries 
will be used to determine which weather event types 
were the most harmful to population health (with respect to injuries) 
combined with the fact that the average doesn't represent well 
the distribution of variables with high skewness, 
as it is highly affected by the most extreme values, 
it was considered necessary to examine the subsets 
created by those two levels in order to obtain an insightful picture. 

```{r create_the_table_with_the_processed_data_for_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_injuries}

# Create the table with the processed data 
# for the harm on population health with respect to injuries.
processed_data_____harm_on_population_health_____injuries <- 
  target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____injuries[

    ## Create a new variable divides the observations
    ## for each weather event into two supplementary groups:  
    ##   - the 90% of weather events that resulted in lowest injuries

    BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE := (function(x, p_bins) {
      
      # adds 0 and 1 in the vector supplied at the argument 'p_bins' 
      # to the start and the end respectively  
      # the supplied percentiles if they are missing 
      # and sort them ascending
      p_bins_increasing <- sort(c(0, p_bins, 1))
      
      # creates the character strings that labels of the bins by the values supplied at 
      # the argument 'p_bins' that will be the values of the new variable
      bin_labels <- paste0("(", p_bins_increasing[-length(p_bins_increasing)]*100,
                           "% - ", p_bins_increasing[-1]*100, "%]")
      
      # identify the number of occurrences that correspond to each label
      n_times <- vapply(2:length(p_bins_increasing),
                        function(i) {
                          as.integer(floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i]) -
                                       floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i - 1]))
                        }, integer(1))
      
      # multiply each label with the number of its occurrences
      x_bins_expanded <- rep(x = bin_labels, times = n_times)
      
      # order the label to much the values of the corresponding vector
      x_bins_expanded_reordered <- x_bins_expanded[order(seq_along(x)[order(x)])]
      
      ## Coerce the character vector with the labels of bins to a factor
      x_bins_factor <- factor(x_bins_expanded_reordered, labels = bin_labels, ordered = TRUE)
      
    })(INJURIES, 0.9)
    , by = EVENT_TYPE
  ][
    ## Coerce the EVENT_VARIABLE to factor
    , EVENT_TYPE := as.factor(EVENT_TYPE) 
  ]

```

The table with the processed data for the harm on population health 
with respect to injuries contains 4 variables:  

  1. **REFNUM** (int) : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **EVENT_TYPE** (Factor w/ 27 levels) : the type of each weather event
  3. **INJURIES** (int) : the number of injuries  
  4. **BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE** (Ord.factor w/ 2 levels) : 
  a factor that divides the observations for each 
  weather event type to two complementary levels, 
  one with the 90% of observations with the lowest impact and 
  another with the 10% of observations with the highest impact.

and 5581 observations.

### 8.2.3 Summarize the processed data for harm on population health with respect to injuries by each weather event type {#ind-8-2-3--Summarize-the-processed-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-injuries-by-each-weather-event-type}  

To evaluate the harm on population health by each weather event type 
with respect to injuries a simplistic approach was adopted :  

  * the weather event types were ranked 
  from the most harmful to the least 
  based on the overall average number of injuries 
  of the weather events that resulted in non-zero injuries

The overall average number of injuries caused by each weather event type 
was initially examined along with the skewness of the number of injuries 
for each weather event type. In most cases the skewness was high 
(or even extremely high), so it was possible that the overall mean 
misrepresented the consequences of each weather event type.  

That is the reason why the average number of injuries for 90% of weather events 
with the lowest impact versus the average number of injuries for the 10% of 
weather events with the highest impact were also computed and examined.  

**It is highlighted that for the average number of injuries 
that refers to the 10% of the cases that had the highest impact, 
there were few observations available for a lot of weather event types 
and the corresponding mean values should be interpreted with caution.**

### 8.2.4 Visualize the results of the summary for the harm on population health with respect to injuries by each weather event type {#ind-8-2-4--Visualize-the-results-of-the-summary-for-the-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-injuries-by-each-weather-event-type}  

From the table with the summary for the harm on population health 
by each weather event type with respect to injuries 
the **Multiplot 1.2** was created to present an overview of the results 
for the three different aspects that were examined for this perspective.  

Four elementary plots were 
[created](#ind-8-2-4-1--Create-the-components-of-Multiplot-1-2):  

* [8.2.4.1.1 Create The Plot 1.2.1](#ind-8-2-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-1-2-1)  
  * Displays the overall average number of injuries 
  caused by each weather event type based 
  on all the cases of weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
* [8.2.4.1.2 Create The Plot 1.2.2](#ind-8-2-4-1-2--Create-The-Plot-1-2-2)  
  * Displays the average number of injuries 
  caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
  with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
* [8.2.4.1.3 Create The Plot 1.2.3](#ind-8-2-4-1-3--Create-The-Plot-1-2-3)  
  * Displays the average number of injuries 
  caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
  with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
* [8.2.4.1.4 Create The Plot 1.2.4](#ind-8-2-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-1-2-4)
  * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
  of the average number of injuries for the 90% of its observations 
  with the lowest impact versus the average number of injuries 
  for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
  based only on the weather events that resulted in non-zero injuries.  
     
which were then [combined](#ind-8-2-4-2--Compose-the-Multiplot-1-2) 
in order to obtain the **Multiplot 1.2**.

It constitutes the *PART 2* of the *Figure 1* 
that displays the overview of the harm on population health 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 1.1 
nor the elementary plots that it contains were presented in this section 
due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment to include in the report 
at least 1 but no more than 3 figures. 
It can be examined at the subsection 
[10.1.1 Overview of results for the harm on population health
](#ind-10-1-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-population-health) 
at the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS), 
were the Figure 1 was presented, 
of which the Multiplot 1.2 constitutes the PART 2.)*

The *Plot 1.2.1* displays 
**the overall average number of injuries** 
caused by each weather event type taking into account 
all and only the observation that resulted in non-zero injuries. 

The weather event types were matched with a number 
that represents the rank which was assigned to each of them 
from the most harmful to the least with respect to population health, 
based on the **overall average number of injuries** they caused.  

The skewness of the number of injuries 
for the observations of each weather event type
(based on which the overall number of injuries was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

## 8.3 Harm On Population Health With Respect To Casualties By Each Weather Event Type {#ind-8-3--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Casualties-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

The required variables and the target data subset of observations 
for the harm on population health with respect to casualties 
were extracted from the table with the processed data, 
and processed to create a new variable that divided the observations 
for each of the included weather event types to two supplementary groups:  

* the 90% of observations with the lowest impact  
* the 10% of observations with the highest impact  
  
before the information for the harm on population health 
with respect to casualties was summarized by each weather event type.  

Three aspects were examined: 
  
  1. The overall average number of casualties by each weather event type.  
  2. The average number of casualties by each weather event type 
  for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact.  
  3. The average number of casualties by each weather event type 
  for the 10% of cases with the highest impact.  

For each aspect, the average number of casualties 
by each weather event type, the number of its
available observations (based on which the average was computed) 
and their skewness were examined. 

The overall average number of casualties was used as the main criterion 
to determine which weather events caused the most harm on population health 
with respect to casualties but it is important to take into account 
the other two aspect that were presented in order to obtain a more insightful 
and complete 'picture' of their consequences, 
(especially given the fact that for most of the weather event types, 
the casualties were highly positively skewed).

The table with results for the harm on population health 
with respect to casualties by each weather event type 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.1.4 Most harmful event types with respect to casualties
](#ind-10-1-4--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-casualties) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).

Finally the *Multiplot 1.3* was created to visualize 
the results of the harm on population health with respect to casualties 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 1.3 nor the elementary plots that it contains 
were presented in this section due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment 
to include in the report at least 1 but no more than 3 figures. 
It can be examined at the subsection

### 8.3.1 Extract the target data for harm on population health with respect to casualties {#ind-8-3-1--Extract-the-target-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-casualties}  

In order to examine the harm on population health with respect to casualties 
caused by each weather event type, 
the variables *REFNUM*, *EVENT_TYPE* and *CASUALTIES* 
were selected from the table with the processed data and 
**only the observations that refer to weather events 
that resulted in non-zero casualties** were extracted. 

Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid highly misleading statistics 
due to the small number of observations for some of the weather event types, 
a lowest bound of 10 weather events that caused non zero casualties 
(for each of the included weather event types)
was selected (subjectively by the analyst) and applied. 

This lowest bound, although it may seem (and generally it is) not enough 
to get trustworthy statistics, it was considered to be *"good enough"* 
taking into account that : 
  
  1. the analysis focuses in describing historical data 
  without trying to make inferences 
  that would demand substantially bigger samples, 
  although any statistic based on less than 10 observations 
  could not be taken seriously 
  especially in cases (such as in this analysis) where the distribution 
  of casualties for each weather event type was skewed.
  2. a period of 10 years (from 2001 to 2011) 
  in which the observations that were used in the analysis occurred, 
  is relatively small time to produce big samples of weather events 
  that caused non zero casualties for some the weather event types. 
  Thus, if a highest bound was selected to get more robust statistics 
  such as samples of 100 or 300, the majority of weather event types 
  would have been excluded, making the results of the analysis trivial.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_casualties}

# Extract the required variables and the target data subset of observations 
# for the harm on population health with respect to casualties.
target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____casualties <- processed_data[
  ## Extract only the observations that have resulted in non-zero casualties.
  CASUALTIES > 0,
  ## Select only the relevant variables. 
  list(REFNUM, EVENT_TYPE, CASUALTIES)
  ][
    ### Keep only the observations that correspond to the weather event types 
    ### for which there are at least 10 weather events available.
    EVENT_TYPE %in% 
      names(table(EVENT_TYPE)[table(EVENT_TYPE) >= 10])
    ]

```

The table with the target data for the harm on population health 
with respect to casualties consist of 7936 observations. 

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_casualties} 

# Print the structure of the table with the target data subset 
# for the harm on population health with respect to casualties.
str(target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____casualties)

```

The variable *EVENT_TYPE* includes 30 distinct weather event types, 
for most of which the variable *CASUALTIES* was highly positively skewed. 

It was worth noting that for the weather event types 
with highest number of observations 
there was highest skewness for the values of casualties, 
indicating that the corresponding distribution of casualties
has a heavy tail that wasn't possible to be observed 
when few observation were available.  

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_some_facts_for_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_casualties}

    order(EVENT_TYPE), 
    list(

    ),

### 8.3.2 Process the target data for harm on population health with respect to casualties {#ind-8-3-2--Process-the-target-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-casualties}  

To create the table with the processed data 
for the harm on population health with respect to casualties 
from the corresponding target data subset for this perspective,
a new variable was created that divides the observations 
for each of the included weather event types in two complementary levels: 

* one that contains the 90% of cases with lowest impact  
* the other that contains the 10% of cases with highest impact  

This decision was made due to the high skewness that was observed 
for the values of the variable *CASUALTIES* for most weather event types, 
which indicates that the underlining distributions of such phenomena 
has a heavy tail that causes this heterogeneity on the observations. 
As a result a small number of casualties were observed 
for the majority of cases that resulted in non-zero casualties 
while in the few cases with the highest impact 
they caused lots of casualties. 

Having in mind that the average number of casualties 
will be used to determine which weather event types 
were the most harmful to population health (with respect to casualties) 
combined with the fact that the average doesn't represent well 
the distribution of variables with high skewness, 
as it is highly affected by the most extreme values, 
it was considered necessary to examine the subsets 
created by those two levels in order to obtain an insightful picture. 


```{r create_the_table_with_the_processed_data_for_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_casualties}

# Create the table with the processed data 
# for the harm on population health with respect to casualties.
processed_data_____harm_on_population_health_____casualties <- 
  target_data_____harm_on_population_health_____casualties[
    ,
    ## Create a new variable divides the observations
    ## for each weather event into two supplementary groups:  
    ##   - the 90% of weather events that resulted in lowest casualties

    BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE := (function(x, p_bins) {
      
      # adds 0 and 1 in the vector supplied at the argument 'p_bins' 
      # to the start and the end respectively  
      # the supplied percentiles if they are missing 
      # and sort them ascending
      p_bins_increasing <- sort(c(0, p_bins, 1))
      
      # creates the character strings that labels of the bins by the values supplied at 
      # the argument 'p_bins' that will be the values of the new variable
      bin_labels <- paste0("(", p_bins_increasing[-length(p_bins_increasing)]*100,
                           "% - ", p_bins_increasing[-1]*100, "%]")
      
      # identify the number of occurrences that correspond to each label
      n_times <- vapply(2:length(p_bins_increasing),
                        function(i) {
                          as.integer(floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i]) -
                                       floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i - 1]))
                        }, integer(1))
      
      # multiply each label with the number of its occurrences
      x_bins_expanded <- rep(x = bin_labels, times = n_times)
      
      # order the label to much the values of the corresponding vector
      x_bins_expanded_reordered <- x_bins_expanded[order(seq_along(x)[order(x)])]
      
      ## Coerce the character vector with the labels of bins to a factor
      x_bins_factor <- factor(x_bins_expanded_reordered, labels = bin_labels, ordered = TRUE)
      
    })(CASUALTIES, 0.9), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
  ][
    ## Coerce the EVENT_VARIABLE to factor
    , EVENT_TYPE := as.factor(EVENT_TYPE) 
  ]

```

The table with the processed data for the harm on population health 
with respect to casualties contains 4 variables:  

  1. **REFNUM** (int) : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **EVENT_TYPE** (Factor w/ 30 levels) : the type of each weather event
  3. **CASUALTIES** (int ): the number of casualties  
  4. **BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE** (Ord.factor w/ 2 levels) : 
  a factor that divides the observations for each 
  weather event type to two complementary levels, 
  one with the 90% of observations with the lowest impact and 
  another with the 10% of observations with the highest impact.

and 7936 observations.

### 8.3.3 Summarize the processed data for harm on population health with respect to casualties by each weather event type {#ind-8-3-3--Summarize-the-processed-data-for-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-casualties-by-each-weather-event-type}  

To evaluate the harm on population health by each weather event type 
with respect to casualties a simplistic approach was adopted :  

  * the weather event types were ranked 
  from the most harmful to the least 
  based on the overall average number of casualties 
  of the weather events that resulted in non-zero casualties

The overall average number of casualties caused by each weather event type 
was initially examined along with the skewness of the number of casualties 
for each weather event type. In most cases the skewness was high 
(or even extremely high), so it was possible that the overall mean 
misrepresented the consequences of each weather event type.  

That is the reason why the average number of casualties for 90% of weather events 
with the lowest impact versus the average number of casualties for the 10% of 
weather events with the highest impact were also computed and examined.  

**It is highlighted that for the average number of casualties 
that refers to the 10% of the cases that had the highest impact, 
there were few observations available for a lot of weather event types 
and the corresponding mean values should be interpreted with caution.**

```{r create_the_table_with_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_casualties_by_each_weather_event_type}

      ]

```

The results of the table with the summary 
for the harm on population health with respect to casualties
by each weather event type that was created in this section 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.1.4 Most harmful event types with respect to casualties
](#ind-10-1-4--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-casualties) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS). 

The table with the summary for the harm on population health 
with respect to casualties by each weather event type 
was exported (as an R file), in the folder of the working directory: 

* *outputs --> harm_on_population_health --> results* 
  
with filename:  

* *summary______harm_on_population_health______casualties.R*
  
```{r exprot_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_population_health_with_respect_to_casualties}

# Supply the filepath at which the table with the summary
# for the harm on population health will be exported.
filepath_____summary_____harm_on_population_health______casualties <-
  file.path(
    directory_tree_____outputs[[
      "filepath_____outputs_____harm_on_population_health_____results"
      ]],
    "summary_____harm_on_population_health______casualties.R"
  )

# Export the table with the summary for the harm on population health
# with respect to casualties.
saveRDS(
  object = summary_____harm_on_population_health______casualties,
  file = filepath_____summary_____harm_on_population_health______casualties
)

```

*The main reason for exporting the file 
with the summary for the harm on population health with respect to casualties 
by each weather event type was to supply a checkpoint 
for any attempts to reproduce the analysis.*

### 8.3.4 Visualize the results of the summary for the harm on population health with respect to casualties by each weather event type {#ind-8-3-4--Visualize-the-results-of-the-summary-for-the-harm-on-population-health-with-respect-to-casualties-by-each-weather-event-type}  

From the table with the summary for the harm on population health 
by each weather event type with respect to casualties 
the **Multiplot 1.3** was created to present an overview of the results 
for the three different aspects that were examined for this perspective.  

Four elementary plots were 
[created](#ind-8-3-4-1--Create-the-components-of-Multiplot-1-3):  

* [8.3.4.1.1 Create The Plot 1.3.1](#ind-8-3-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-1-3-1)  
  * Displays the overall average number of casualties 
  caused by each weather event type based 
  on all the cases of weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero casualties.  
* [8.3.4.1.2 Create The Plot 1.3.2](#ind-8-3-4-1-2--Create-The-Plot-1-3-2)  
  * Displays the average number of casualties 
  caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
  with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero casualties.  
* [8.3.4.1.3 Create The Plot 1.3.3](#ind-8-3-4-1-3--Create-The-Plot-1-3-3)  
  * Displays the average number of casualties 
  caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
  with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero casualties.  
* [8.3.4.1.4 Create The Plot 1.3.4](#ind-8-3-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-1-3-4)
  * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
  of the average number of casualties for the 90% of its observations 
  with the lowest impact versus the average number of casualties 
  for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
  based only on the weather events that resulted in non-zero casualties.  

which were then [combined](#ind-8-3-4-2--Compose-the-Multiplot-1-3) 
in order to obtain the **Multiplot 1.3**.

It constitutes the *PART 3* of the *Figure 1* 
that displays the overview of the harm on population health 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 1.3 
nor the elementary plots that it contains were presented in this section 
due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment to include in the report 
at least 1 but no more than 3 figures. 
It can be examined at the subsection 
[10.1.1 Overview of results for the harm on population health
](#ind-10-1-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-population-health) 
at the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS), 
were the Figure 1 was presented, 
of which the Multiplot 1.2 constitutes the PART 2.)*

The *Plot 1.3.1* displays 
**the overall average number of casualties** 
caused by each weather event type taking into account 
all and only the observation that resulted in non-zero casualties. 

The weather event types were matched with a number

##### **8.3.4.1.4 Create The Plot 1.3.4** {#ind-8-3-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-1-3-4}

The *Plot 1.3.4* displays 
a compact overview of all three aspect that were examined 
for the harm on population health with respect to casualties.  

For each weather event type, the comparison was visualized for 
**the average number of casualties for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact** 
versus
**the average number of casualties for the 10% of cases with the highest impact**.

The weather event types were matched with a number 
that represents the rank which was assigned to each of them 
from the most harmful to the least with respect to population health, 
based on the **overall average number of casualties** they caused.  

The skewness of the number of casualties 
for the observations of each weather event type
(based on which the overall number of casualties was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

***  
# 9 HARM ON ECONOMY {#ind-9--HARM-ON-ECONOMY}  
***  

In this chapter an attempt was made to quantify the harm on economy 
based on the information from the 
[table with the processed data](#ind-7--PROCESSED-DATA).
    
The harm on economy was examined over three perspectives:  
        
1. [The harm on economy with respect to property damage 
caused by each weather event type 
based on the observations for weather events 
that resulted in non-zero property damage 
at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011.
](#ind-9-1--Harm-On-Economy-With-Respect-To-Property-Damage-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)  
2. [The harm on economy with respect to crop damage 
caused by each weather event type 
based on the observations for weather events 
that resulted in non-zero crop damage 
at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011.
](#ind-9-2--Harm-On-Economy-With-Respect-To-Crop-Damage-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)  
3. [The harm on economy with respect to economic damage  
(sum of property damage and crop damage) 
caused by each weather event type
based on the observations for weather events 
that resulted in non-zero economic damage 
at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011.
](#ind-9-3--Harm-On-Economy-With-Respect-To-Economic-Damage-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)  

The weather event types for which less 
than 10 observations that resulted in non-zero harm were available 
with respect to a perspective of interest were ommited 
(from the analysis of that particular perspective),
to avoid highly misleading statistics. 
Consequently the subset of weather event types 
that were included for each of the three perspectives is different.  

Due to the fact that for all perspectives 
the values of interest for the observations 
of most weather event types were highly positively skewed, 
it was consider important in order to obtain an insightful picture 
of their consequences to examine them over three different apsects:  

  1. The **overall** harm on economy 
  caused by each weather event type.  
  2. The harm on economy cauced by 
  **the 90% of cases with the lowest impact** 
  of each weather event type.  
  3. The harm on economy cauced by 
  **the 10% of cases with the highest impact** 
  of each weather event type.  
  
For every apsect the sample size, the skewness and the mean 
of the values that encapsulated the harm with respect to each perspective 
were summarized by each weather event type and reported.  

The results obtained for the harm on economy by each weather event type 
were presented at the section 
[10.2 Question 2 : Across the United States, 
which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
](#ind-10-2--results-harm-on-economy)
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).  

(In compliance with the restrictions of the assignment, 
according to which at least 1 but no more than 3 figures 
should be included in the report, the multiplots as well as the elementary plots 
that they contain were NOT displayed separately 
and can ONLY be examined as PARTs of the Figure 2 at the subsection 
[10.2.1 Overview of results for the harm on economy
](#ind-10-2-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-economy) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).)

## 9.1 Harm On Economy With Respect To Property Damage By Each Weather Event Type {#ind-9-1--Harm-On-Economy-With-Respect-To-Property-Damage-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

The required variables and the target data subset of observations 
for the harm on economy with respect to property damage 
were extracted from the table with the processed data, 
and processed to create a new variable that divided the observations 
for each of the included weather event types to two supplementary groups:  

* the 90% of observations with the lowest impact  
* the 10% of observations with the highest impact  
  
before the information for the harm on economy 
with respect to property damage was summarized 
by each weather event type.  

Three aspects were examined: 
  
  1. The overall average property damage by each weather event type.  
  2. The average property damage by each weather event type 
  for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact.  
  3. The average property damage by each weather event type 
  for the 10% of cases with the highest impact.  

For each aspect, the average property damage 
by each weather event type, the number of its
available observations (based on which the average was computed) 
and their skewness were examined. 

The overall average property damage was used as the main criterion 
to determine which weather events caused the most harm on economy
with respect to property damage but it is important to take into account 
the other two aspect that were presented in order to obtain a more insightful 
and complete 'picture' of their consequences, 
(especially given the fact that for most of the weather event types, 
the property damage were highly positively skewed).

The table with results for the harm on economy 
with respect to property damage by each weather event type 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.2.2 Most harmful event types with respect to property damage
](#ind-10-2-2--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-property-damage) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).

Finally the *Multiplot 2.1* was created to visualize 
the results of the harm on economy with respect to property damage 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 2.1 nor the elementary plots that it contains 
were presented in this section due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment 
to include in the report at least 1 but no more than 3 figures. 
It can be examined at the subsection 
[10.2.1 Overview of results for the harm on economy

### 9.1.1 Extract the target data for harm on economy with respect to property damage {#ind-9-1-1--Extract-the-target-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-property-damage}  

In order to examine the harm on economy with respect to property damage 
caused by each weather event type, 
the variables *REFNUM*, *EVENT_TYPE* and *PROPERTY_DAMAGE* 
were selected from the table with the processed data and 
**only the observations that refer to weather events 
that resulted in non-zero property damage** were extracted. 

Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid highly misleading statistics 
due to the small number of observations for some of the weather event types, 
a lowest bound of 10 weather events that caused non zero property damage 
(for each of the included weather event types)
was selected (subjectively by the analyst) and applied. 

This lowest bound, although it may seem (and generally it is) not enough 
to get trustworthy statistics, it was considered to be *"good enough"* 
taking into account that : 
  
  1. the analysis focuses in describing historical data 
  without trying to make inferences 
  that would demand substantially bigger samples, 
  although any statistic based on less than 10 observations 
  could not be taken seriously 
  especially in cases (such as in this analysis) where the distribution 
  of property damage for each weather event type was skewed.
  2. a period of 11 years (from 2001 to 2011) 
  in which the observations that were used in the analysis occurred, 
  is relatively small time to produce big samples of weather events 
  that caused non zero property damage for some the weather event types. 
  Thus, if a highest bound was selected to get more robust statistics 
  such as samples of 100 or 300, the majority of weather event types 
  would have been excluded, making the results of the analysis trivial.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_property_damage}

# Extract the required variables and the target data subset of observations 
# for the harm on economy with respect to property damage.
target_data_____harm_on_economy_____property_damage <- processed_data[
  ## Extract only the observations that have resulted in non-zero property damage.
  PROPERTY_DAMAGE > 0,
  ## Select only the relevant variables. 
  list(REFNUM, EVENT_TYPE, PROPERTY_DAMAGE)
  ][
    ### Keep only the observations that correspond to the weather event types 
    ### for which there are at least 10 weather events available.
    EVENT_TYPE %in% 
      names(table(EVENT_TYPE)[table(EVENT_TYPE) >= 10])
    ]

```

The table with the target data for the harm on economy 
with respect to property damage consist of 136928 observations. 

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_property_damage} 

# Print the structure of the table with the target data subset 
# for the harm on economy with respect to property damage.
str(target_data_____harm_on_economy_____property_damage)

```

The variable *EVENT_TYPE* includes 37 distinct weather event types, 
for most of which the variable *PROPERTY_DAMAGE* was highly positively skewed. 

```{r create_a_kable_to_present_some_facts_for_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_property_damage}

# Create a kable to present some facts about the table with the target data 
# for the harm on economy with respect to property damage.
kable(
  x = target_data_____harm_on_economy_____property_damage[
    order(EVENT_TYPE), 
    list(
      "N" = .N, 
      "SKEWNESS" = round(skewness(PROPERTY_DAMAGE), 4)
    ), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
    ],
  caption = paste0(
    "Table 9.1.1-1: ",
    "Facts about the table with the target data subset of observations ",

    full_width = FALSE,
    fixed_thead = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  footnote(
    general = "The skewness was rounded to 4 decimal places."
  )

```

It was worth noting that for the weather event types 
with highest number of observations 
there was highest skewness for the values of property damage, 
indicating that the corresponding distribution of property damage
has a heavy tail that wasn't possible to be observed 
when few observation were available.

### 9.1.2 Process the target data for harm on economy with respect to property damage {#ind-9-1-2--Process-the-target-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-property-damage}  

To create the table with the processed data 
for the harm on economy with respect to property damage 
from the corresponding target data subset for this perspective,
a new variable was created that divides the observations 
for each of the included weather event types in two complementary levels: 

* one that contains the 90% of cases with lowest impact  
* the other that contains the 10% of cases with highest impact  

This decision was made due to the high skewness that was observed 
for the values of the variable *PROPERTY_DAMAGE* for most weather event types, 
which indicates that the underlining distributions of such phenomena 
has a heavy tail that causes this heterogeneity on the observations. 
As a result a small property damage were observed 
for the majority of cases that resulted in non-zero fatalities 
while in the few cases with the highest impact 
they caused lots of property damage. 

Having in mind that the average property damage 
will be used to determine which weather event types 
were the most harmful to economy (with respect to property damage) 
combined with the fact that the average doesn't represent well 
the distribution of variables with high skewness, 
as it is highly affected by the most extreme values, 
it was considered necessary to examine the subsets 
created by those two levels in order to obtain an insightful picture. 


```{r create_the_table_with_the_processed_data_for_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_property_damage}

# Create the table with the processed data 
# for the harm on economy with respect to property damage.
processed_data_____harm_on_economy_____property_damage <- 
  target_data_____harm_on_economy_____property_damage[

    ## Create a new variable divides the observations
    ## for each weather event into two supplementary groups:  
    ##   - the 90% of weather events that resulted in lowest fatalities
    ##   - the 10% of weather events that resulted in highest fatalities
    BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE := (function(x, p_bins) {
      
      # adds 0 and 1 in the vector supplied at the argument 'p_bins' 
      # to the start and the end respectively  
      # the supplied percentiles if they are missing 
      # and sort them ascending
      p_bins_increasing <- sort(c(0, p_bins, 1))
      
      # creates the character strings that labels of the bins by the values supplied at 
      # the argument 'p_bins' that will be the values of the new variable
      bin_labels <- paste0("(", p_bins_increasing[-length(p_bins_increasing)]*100,
                           "% - ", p_bins_increasing[-1]*100, "%]")
      
      # identify the number of occurrences that correspond to each label
      n_times <- vapply(2:length(p_bins_increasing),
                        function(i) {
                          as.integer(floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i]) -
                                       floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i - 1]))
                        }, integer(1))
      
      # multiply each label with the number of its occurrences
      x_bins_expanded <- rep(x = bin_labels, times = n_times)
      
      # order the label to much the values of the corresponding vector
      x_bins_expanded_reordered <- x_bins_expanded[order(seq_along(x)[order(x)])]
      
      ## Coerce the character vector with the labels of bins to a factor
      x_bins_factor <- factor(x_bins_expanded_reordered, labels = bin_labels, ordered = TRUE)
      
    })(PROPERTY_DAMAGE, 0.9), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
  ][
    ## Coerce the EVENT_VARIABLE to factor
    , EVENT_TYPE := as.factor(EVENT_TYPE) 
  ]

```

The table with the processed data for the harm on economy 
with respect to property damage contains 4 variables:  

  1. **REFNUM** (int) : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **EVENT_TYPE** (Factor w/ 37 levels) : the type of each weather event
  3. **PROPERTY_DAMAGE** (int) : the property damage in dollars  
  4. **BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE** (Ord.factor w/ 2 levels) : 
  a factor that divides the observations for each 
  weather event type to two complementary levels, 
  one with the 90% of observations with the lowest impact and 
  another with the 10% of observations with the highest impact.

and 136928 observations.

### 9.1.3 Summarize the processed data for harm on economy with respect to property damage by each weather event type {#ind-9-1-3--Summarize-the-processed-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-property-damage-by-each-weather-event-type}  

To evaluate the harm on economy by each weather event type 
with respect to property damage a simplistic approach was adopted :  

  * the weather event types were ranked 
  from the most harmful to the least 
  based on the overall average property damage 
  of the weather events that resulted in non-zero property damage

The overall average property damage caused by each weather event type 
was initially examined along with the skewness of the property damage 
for each weather event type. In most cases the skewness was high 
(or even extremely high), so it was possible that the overall mean 
misrepresented the consequences of each weather event type.  

That is the reason why the average property damage for 90% of weather events 
with the lowest impact versus the average property damage for the 10% of 
weather events with the highest impact were also computed and examined.  

**It is highlighted that for the average property damage 
that refers to the 10% of the cases that had the highest impact, 
there were few observations available for a lot of weather event types 
and the corresponding mean values should be interpreted with caution.**

```{r create_the_table_with_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_property_damage_by_each_weather_event_type}

      )
      ]

```

The results of the table with the summary 
for the harm on economy with respect to property damage
by each weather event type that was created in this section 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.2.2 Most harmful event types with respect to property damage
](#ind-10-2-2--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-property-damage) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).

The table with the summary for the harm on economy 
with respect to property damage by each weather event type 
was exported (as an R file), in the folder of the working directory: 

* *outputs --> harm_on_economy --> results* 
  
with filename:  

* *summary______harm_on_economy______property_damage.R*
  
In addition a txt file that contains the MD5 hash of the file 
was created and saved at the same directory with filename:  

* *summary_____harm_on_economy______property_damage.R-----(MD5 HASH).txt*

```{r exprot_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_property_damage}

# Supply the filepath at which the table with the summary
# for the harm on economy will be exported.
filepath_____summary_____harm_on_economy______property_damage <-
  file.path(
    directory_tree_____outputs[[
      "filepath_____outputs_____harm_on_economy_____results"
    ]],
    "summary_____harm_on_economy______property_damage.R"
  )

# Export the table with the summary for the harm on economy
# with respect to property damage.
saveRDS(
  object = summary_____harm_on_economy______property_damage,
  file = filepath_____summary_____harm_on_economy______property_damage
)

```

The main reason for exporting the file with the summary 
for the harm on economy with respect to property damage 
by each weather event type was to supply a checkpoint 
for any attempts to reproduce the analysis.

From the table with the summary for the harm on economy 
by each weather event type with respect to property damage 
the **Multiplot 2.1** was created to present an overview of the results 
for the three different aspects that were examined for this perspective.  

Four elementary plots were 
[created](#ind-9-1-4-2--Compose-the-Multiplot-2-1):  

* [9.1.4.1.1 Create The Plot 2.1.1](#ind-9-1-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-2-1-1)  
  * Displays the overall average property damage 
  caused by each weather event type based 
  on all the cases of weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero property damage.  
* [9.1.4.1.2 Create The Plot 2.1.2](#ind-9-1-4-1-2--Create-The-Plot-2-1-2)  
  * Displays the average property damage 
  caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
  with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero property damage.  
* [9.1.4.1.3 Create The Plot 2.1.3](#ind-9-1-4-1-3--Create-The-Plot-2-1-3)  
  * Displays the average property damage 
  caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
  with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero property damage.  
* [9.1.4.1.4 Create The Plot 2.1.4](#ind-9-1-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-2-1-4)  
  * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
  of the average property damage for the 90% of its observations 
  with the lowest impact versus the average property damage 
  for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
  based only on the weather events that resulted 
  in non-zero property damage.  

which were then [combined](#Compose-the-Multiplot-2-1) 
in order to obtain the **Multiplot 2.1**.

It constitutes the *PART 1* of the *Figure 2* 
that displays the overview of the harm on economy 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 2.1 
nor the elementary plots that it contains 
were presented in this section 
due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment 
to include in the report at least 1 but no more than 3 figures. 
It can be examined at the subsection

##### **9.1.4.1.1 Create The Plot 2.1.1** {#ind-9-1-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-2-1-1}

The *Plot 2.1.1* displays 
**the overall average property damage** 
caused by each weather event type taking into account 
all and only the observation that resulted in non-zero property damage. 

The weather event types were matched with a number 
that represents the rank which was assigned to each of them 
from the most harmful to the least with respect to economy, 
based on the **overall average property damage** they caused.  

The skewness of the property damage 
for the observations of each weather event type
(based on which the overall property damage was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

##### **9.1.4.1.2 Create The Plot 2.1.2** {#ind-9-1-4-1-2--Create-The-Plot-2-1-2}

The *Elementary Plot 2.1.2* displays 
**the average property damage for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact** 
caused by each weather event type 
from all the observation that resulted in non-zero property damage. 

The weather event types were matched with a number 
that represents the rank which was assigned to each of them 
from the most harmful to the least with respect to economy, 
based on the **overall average property damage** they caused.  
(so it is NOT based on the average property damage 
caused by the 90% of cases with the lowest impact of each weather event type).  

The skewness of the property damage 
for the observations of each weather event type
(based on which the average property damage for the 90% of cases 
with the lowest impact was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

The *Plot 2.1.4* displays 
a compact overview of all three aspect that were examined 
for the harm on economy with respect to property damage.  

For each weather event type, the comparison was visualized for 
**the average property damage for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact** 
versus
**the average property damage for the 10% of cases with the highest impact**.

The weather event types were matched with a number

## 9.2 Harm On Economy With Respect To Crop Damage By Each Weather Event Type {#ind-9-2--Harm-On-Economy-With-Respect-To-Crop-Damage-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

The required variables and the target data subset of observations 
for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage 
were extracted from the table with the processed data, 
and processed to create a new variable that divided the observations 
for each of the included weather event types to two supplementary groups:  

* the 90% of observations with the lowest impact  
* the 10% of observations with the highest impact  
  
before the information for the harm on economy 
with respect to crop damage was summarized 
by each weather event type.  

Three aspects were examined: 
  
  1. The overall average crop damage by each weather event type.  
  2. The average crop damage by each weather event type 
  for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact.  
  3. The average crop damage by each weather event type 
  for the 10% of cases with the highest impact.  

For each aspect, the average crop damage 
by each weather event type, the number of its
available observations (based on which the average was computed) 
and their skewness were examined. 

The overall average crop damage was used as the main criterion 
to determine which weather events caused the most harm on economy
with respect to crop damage but it is important to take into account 
the other two aspect that were presented in order to obtain a more insightful 
and complete 'picture' of their consequences, 
(especially given the fact that for most of the weather event types, 
the crop damage were highly positively skewed).

The table with results for the harm on economy 
with respect to crop damage by each weather event type 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.2.3 Most harmful event types with respect to crop damage
](#ind-10-2-3--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-crop-damage) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).  

Finally the *Multiplot 2.2* was created to visualize 
the results of the harm on economy with respect to crop damage 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 2.2 nor the elementary plots that it contains 
were presented in this section due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment 
to include in the report at least 1 but no more than 3 figures.

### 9.2.1 Extract the target data for harm on economy with respect to crop damage {#ind-9-2-1--Extract-the-target-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-crop-damage}  

In order to examine the harm on economy with respect to crop damage 
caused by each weather event type, 
the variables *REFNUM*, *EVENT_TYPE* and *CROP_DAMAGE* 
were selected from the table with the processed data and 
**only the observations that refer to weather events 
that resulted in non-zero crop damage** were extracted. 

Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid highly misleading statistics 
due to the small number of observations for some of the weather event types, 
a lowest bound of 10 weather events that caused non zero crop damage 
(for each of the included weather event types)
was selected (subjectively by the analyst) and applied. 

This lowest bound, although it may seem (and generally it is) not enough 
to get trustworthy statistics, it was considered to be *"good enough"* 
taking into account that : 
  
  1. the analysis focuses in describing historical data 
  without trying to make inferences 
  that would demand substantially bigger samples, 
  although any statistic based on less than 10 observations 
  could not be taken seriously 
  especially in cases (such as in this analysis) where the distribution 
  of crop damage for each weather event type was skewed.
  2. a period of 10 years (from 2001 to 2011) 
  in which the observations that were used in the analysis occurred, 
  is relatively small time to produce big samples of weather events 
  that caused non zero crop damage for some the weather event types. 
  Thus, if a highest bound was selected to get more robust statistics 
  such as samples of 100 or 300, the majority of weather event types 
  would have been excluded, making the results of the analysis trivial.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_crop_damage}

# Extract the required variables and the target data subset of observations 
# for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage.
target_data_____harm_on_economy_____crop_damage <- processed_data[
  ## Extract only the observations that have resulted in non-zero crop damage.
  CROP_DAMAGE > 0,
  ## Select only the relevant variables. 
  list(REFNUM, EVENT_TYPE, CROP_DAMAGE)
  ][
    ### Keep only the observations that correspond to the weather event types 
    ### for which there are at least 10 weather events available.
    EVENT_TYPE %in% 
      names(table(EVENT_TYPE)[table(EVENT_TYPE) >= 10])
    ]

```

The table with the target data for the harm on economy 
with respect to crop damage consist of 12177 observations. 

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_crop_damage} 

# Print the structure of the table with the target data subset 
# for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage.
str(target_data_____harm_on_economy_____crop_damage)

```

The variable *EVENT_TYPE* includes 16 distinct weather event types, 
for most of which the variable *CROP_DAMAGE* was highly positively skewed. 

It was worth noting that for the weather event types 
with highest number of observations 
there was highest skewness for the values of crop damage, 
indicating that the corresponding distribution of crop damage
has a heavy tail that wasn't possible to be observed 
when few observation were available.

### 9.2.2 Process the target data for harm on economy with respect to crop damage {#ind-9-2-2--Process-the-target-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-crop-damage}  

To create the table with the processed data 
for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage 
from the corresponding target data subset for this perspective,
a new variable was created that divides the observations 
for each of the included weather event types in two complementary levels: 

* one that contains the 90% of cases with lowest impact  
* the other that contains the 10% of cases with highest impact  

This decision was made due to the high skewness that was observed 
for the values of the variable *CROP_DAMAGE* for most weather event types, 
which indicates that the underlining distributions of such phenomena 
has a heavy tail that causes this heterogeneity on the observations. 
As a result a small crop damage were observed 
for the majority of cases that resulted in non-zero fatalities 
while in the few cases with the highest impact 
they caused lots of crop damage. 

Having in mind that the average crop damage 
will be used to determine which weather event types 
were the most harmful to economy (with respect to crop damage) 
combined with the fact that the average doesn't represent well 
the distribution of variables with high skewness, 
as it is highly affected by the most extreme values, 
it was considered necessary to examine the subsets 
created by those two levels in order to obtain an insightful picture. 

```{r create_the_table_with_the_processed_data_for_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_crop_damage}

# Create the table with the processed data 
# for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage.
processed_data_____harm_on_economy_____crop_damage <- 
  target_data_____harm_on_economy_____crop_damage[
    ,
    ## Create a new variable divides the observations
    ## for each weather event into two supplementary groups:  
    ##   - the 90% of weather events that resulted in lowest fatalities
    ##   - the 10% of weather events that resulted in highest fatalities
    BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE := (function(x, p_bins) {
      
      # adds 0 and 1 in the vector supplied at the argument 'p_bins' 
      # to the start and the end respectively  
      # the supplied percentiles if they are missing 
      # and sort them ascending
      p_bins_increasing <- sort(c(0, p_bins, 1))
      
      # creates the character strings that labels of the bins by the values supplied at 
      # the argument 'p_bins' that will be the values of the new variable
      bin_labels <- paste0("(", p_bins_increasing[-length(p_bins_increasing)]*100,
                           "% - ", p_bins_increasing[-1]*100, "%]")
      
      # identify the number of occurrences that correspond to each label
      n_times <- vapply(2:length(p_bins_increasing),
                        function(i) {
                          as.integer(floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i]) -
                                       floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i - 1]))
                        }, integer(1))
      
      # multiply each label with the number of its occurrences
      x_bins_expanded <- rep(x = bin_labels, times = n_times)
      
      # order the label to much the values of the corresponding vector
      x_bins_expanded_reordered <- x_bins_expanded[order(seq_along(x)[order(x)])]
      
      ## Coerce the character vector with the labels of bins to a factor
      x_bins_factor <- factor(x_bins_expanded_reordered, labels = bin_labels, ordered = TRUE)
      
    })(CROP_DAMAGE, 0.9), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
  ][
    ## Coerce the EVENT_VARIABLE to factor
    , EVENT_TYPE := as.factor(EVENT_TYPE) 
  ]

```

The table with the processed data for the harm on economy 
with respect to crop damage contains 4 variables:  

  1. **REFNUM** (int) : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **EVENT_TYPE** (Factor w/ 16 levels) : the type of each weather event
  3. **CROP_DAMAGE** (int) : the crop damage in dollars  
  4. **BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE** (Ord.factor w/ 2 levels) : 
  a factor that divides the observations for each 
  weather event type to two complementary levels, 
  one with the 90% of observations with the lowest impact and 
  another with the 10% of observations with the highest impact.

and 12177 observations.

### 9.2.3 Summarize the processed data for harm on economy with respect to crop damage by each weather event type {#ind-9-2-3--Summarize-the-processed-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-crop-damage-by-each-weather-event-type}  

To evaluate the harm on economy by each weather event type 
with respect to crop damage a simplistic approach was adopted :  

  * the weather event types were ranked 
  from the most harmful to the least 
  based on the overall average crop damage 
  of the weather events that resulted in non-zero crop damage

The overall average crop damage caused by each weather event type 
was initially examined along with the skewness of the crop damage 
for each weather event type. In most cases the skewness was high 
(or even extremely high), so it was possible that the overall mean 
misrepresented the consequences of each weather event type.  

That is the reason why the average crop damage for 90% of weather events 
with the lowest impact versus the average crop damage for the 10% of 
weather events with the highest impact were also computed and examined.  

**It is highlighted that for the average crop damage 
that refers to the 10% of the cases that had the highest impact, 
there were few observations available for a lot of weather event types 
and the corresponding mean values should be interpreted with caution.**

```{r create_the_table_with_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_crop_damage_by_each_weather_event_type}

```

The results of the table with the summary 
for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage
by each weather event type that was created in this section 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.2.3 Most harmful event types with respect to crop damage
](#ind-10-2-3--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-crop-damage) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).  

The table with the summary for the harm on economy 
with respect to crop damage by each weather event type 
was exported (as an R file), in the folder of the working directory: 

* *outputs --> harm_on_economy --> results* 
  
with filename:  

* *summary______harm_on_economy______crop_damage.R*

```{r exprot_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_crop_damage}

# Supply the filepath at which the table with the summary
# for the harm on economy will be exported.
filepath_____summary_____harm_on_economy______crop_damage <-
  file.path(
    directory_tree_____outputs[[

    ]],
    "summary_____harm_on_economy______crop_damage.R"

# with respect to crop damage.
saveRDS(
  object = summary_____harm_on_economy______crop_damage,
  file = filepath_____summary_____harm_on_economy______crop_damage

```

The main reason for exporting the file with the summary 
for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage by each weather event type 
was to supply a checkpoint for any attempts to reproduce the analysis.

From the table with the summary for the harm on economy 
by each weather event type with respect to crop damage 
the **Multiplot 2.2** was created to present an overview of the results 
for the three different aspects that were examined for this perspective.  

Four elementary plots were 
[created](#ind-9-2-4-1--Create-the-components-of-Multiplot-2-2):  

* [9.2.4.1.1 Create The Plot 2.2.1](#ind-9-2-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-2-2-1)  
  * Displays the overall average crop damage 
  caused by each weather event type based

which were then [combined](#ind-9-2-4-2--Compose-the-Multiplot-2-2) 
in order to obtain the **Multiplot 2.2**.

It constitutes the *PART 2* of the *Figure 2* 
that displays the overview of the harm on economy

##### **9.2.4.1.1 Create The Plot 2.2.1** {#ind-9-2-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-2-2-1}

The *Plot 2.2.1* displays 
**the overall average crop damage** 
caused by each weather event type taking into account 
all and only the observation that resulted in non-zero crop damage. 

The weather event types were matched with a number

from the most harmful to the least with respect to economy, 
based on the **overall average crop damage** they caused.  

The skewness of the crop damage 
for the observations of each weather event type
(based on which the overall crop damage was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

## 9.3 Harm On Economy With Respect To Economic Damage By Each Weather Event Type {#ind-9-3--Harm-On-Economy-With-Respect-To-Economic-Damage-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type}  

<font size="3"><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></font>  

The required variables and the target data subset of observations 
for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage 
were extracted from the table with the processed data, 
and processed to create a new variable that divided the observations 
for each of the included weather event types to two supplementary groups:  

* the 90% of observations with the lowest impact  
* the 10% of observations with the highest impact  
  
before the information for the harm on economy 
with respect to economic damage was summarized 
by each weather event type.  

Three aspects were examined: 
  
  1. The overall average economic damage by each weather event type.  
  2. The average economic damage by each weather event type 
  for the 90% of cases with the lowest impact.  
  3. The average economic damage by each weather event type 
  for the 10% of cases with the highest impact.  

For each aspect, the average economic damage 
by each weather event type, the number of its
available observations (based on which the average was computed) 
and their skewness were examined. 

The overall average economic damage was used as the main criterion 
to determine which weather events caused the most harm on economy
with respect to economic damage but it is important to take into account 
the other two aspect that were presented in order to obtain a more insightful 
and complete 'picture' of their consequences, 
(especially given the fact that for most of the weather event types, 
the economic damage were highly positively skewed).

The table with results for the harm on economy 
with respect to economic damage by each weather event type 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.2.4 Most harmful event types with respect to economic damage
](#ind-10-2-4--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-economic-damage)
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).  

Finally the *Multiplot 2.3* was created to visualize  
the results of the harm on economy with respect to economic damage 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 2.3 nor the elementary plots that it contains

### 9.3.1 Extract the target data for harm on economy with respect to economic damage {#ind-9-3-1--Extract-the-target-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-economic-damage}  

In order to examine the harm on economy with respect to economic damage 
caused by each weather event type, 
the variables *REFNUM*, *EVENT_TYPE* and *ECONOMIC_DAMAGE* 
were selected from the table with the processed data and 
**only the observations that refer to weather events 
that resulted in non-zero economic damage** were extracted. 

Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid highly misleading statistics 
due to the small number of observations for some of the weather event types, 
a lowest bound of 10 weather events that caused non zero economic damage 
(for each of the included weather event types)
was selected (subjectively by the analyst) and applied. 

This lowest bound, although it may seem (and generally it is) not enough 
to get trustworthy statistics, it was considered to be *"good enough"* 
taking into account that : 
  
  1. the analysis focuses in describing historical data 
  without trying to make inferences 
  that would demand substantially bigger samples, 
  although any statistic based on less than 10 observations 
  could not be taken seriously 
  especially in cases (such as in this analysis) where the distribution 
  of economic damage for each weather event type was skewed.
  2. a period of 10 years (from 2001 to 2011) 
  in which the observations that were used in the analysis occurred, 
  is relatively small time to produce big samples of weather events 
  that caused non zero economic damage for some the weather event types. 
  Thus, if a highest bound was selected to get more robust statistics 
  such as samples of 100 or 300, the majority of weather event types 
  would have been excluded, making the results of the analysis trivial.  

```{r create_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_of_observations_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_economic_damage}

# Extract the required variables and the target data subset of observations 
# for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage.
target_data_____harm_on_economy_____economic_damage <- processed_data[
  ## Extract only the observations that have resulted in non-zero economic damage.
  ECONOMIC_DAMAGE > 0,
  ## Select only the relevant variables. 
  list(REFNUM, EVENT_TYPE, ECONOMIC_DAMAGE)
  ][
    ### Keep only the observations that correspond to the weather event types 
    ### for which there are at least 10 weather events available.
    EVENT_TYPE %in% 
      names(table(EVENT_TYPE)[table(EVENT_TYPE) >= 10])
    ]

```

The table with the target data for the harm on economy 
with respect to economic damage consist of 140236 observations. 

```{r print_the_structure_of_the_table_with_the_target_data_subset_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_economic_damage} 

# Print the structure of the table with the target data subset 
# for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage.
str(target_data_____harm_on_economy_____economic_damage)

```

The variable *EVENT_TYPE* includes 37 distinct weather event types, 
for most of which the variable *ECONOMIC_DAMAGE* was highly positively skewed. 

It was worth noting that for the weather event types 
with highest number of observations 
there was highest skewness for the values of economic damage, 
indicating that the corresponding distribution of economic damage
has a heavy tail that wasn't possible to be observed 
when few observation were available.

### 9.3.2 Process the target data for harm on economy with respect to economic damage {#ind-9-3-2--Process-the-target-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-economic-damage}  

To create the table with the processed data 
for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage 
from the corresponding target data subset for this perspective,
a new variable was created that divides the observations 
for each of the included weather event types in two complementary levels: 

* one that contains the 90% of cases with lowest impact  
* the other that contains the 10% of cases with highest impact  

This decision was made due to the high skewness that was observed 
for the values of the variable *ECONOMIC_DAMAGE* for most weather event types, 
which indicates that the underlining distributions of such phenomena 
has a heavy tail that causes this heterogeneity on the observations. 
As a result a small economic damage were observed 
for the majority of cases that resulted in non-zero fatalities 
while in the few cases with the highest impact 
they caused lots of economic damage. 

Having in mind that the average economic damage 
will be used to determine which weather event types 
were the most harmful to economy (with respect to economic damage) 
combined with the fact that the average doesn't represent well 
the distribution of variables with high skewness, 
as it is highly affected by the most extreme values, 
it was considered necessary to examine the subsets 
created by those two levels in order to obtain an insightful picture. 

```{r create_the_table_with_the_processed_data_for_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_economic_damage}

# Create the table with the processed data 
# for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage.
processed_data_____harm_on_economy_____economic_damage <- 
  target_data_____harm_on_economy_____economic_damage[
    ,
    ## Create a new variable divides the observations
    ## for each weather event into two supplementary groups:  
    ##   - the 90% of weather events that resulted in lowest fatalities
    ##   - the 10% of weather events that resulted in highest fatalities
    BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE := (function(x, p_bins) {
      
      # adds 0 and 1 in the vector supplied at the argument 'p_bins' 
      # to the start and the end respectively  
      # the supplied percentiles if they are missing 
      # and sort them ascending
      p_bins_increasing <- sort(c(0, p_bins, 1))
      
      # creates the character strings that labels of the bins by the values supplied at 
      # the argument 'p_bins' that will be the values of the new variable
      bin_labels <- paste0("(", p_bins_increasing[-length(p_bins_increasing)]*100,
                           "% - ", p_bins_increasing[-1]*100, "%]")
      
      # identify the number of occurrences that correspond to each label
      n_times <- vapply(2:length(p_bins_increasing),
                        function(i) {
                          as.integer(floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i]) -
                                       floor(length(x) * p_bins_increasing[i - 1]))
                        }, integer(1))
      
      # multiply each label with the number of its occurrences
      x_bins_expanded <- rep(x = bin_labels, times = n_times)
      
      # order the label to much the values of the corresponding vector
      x_bins_expanded_reordered <- x_bins_expanded[order(seq_along(x)[order(x)])]
      
      ## Coerce the character vector with the labels of bins to a factor
      x_bins_factor <- factor(x_bins_expanded_reordered, labels = bin_labels, ordered = TRUE)
      
    })(ECONOMIC_DAMAGE, 0.9), 
    by = EVENT_TYPE
  ][
    ## Coerce the EVENT_VARIABLE to factor
    , EVENT_TYPE := as.factor(EVENT_TYPE) 
  ]

```

The table with the processed data for the harm on economy 
with respect to economic damage contains 4 variables:  

  1. **REFNUM** (int) : an id that uniquely identifies each observation  
  2. **EVENT_TYPE** (Factor w/ 37 levels) : the type of each weather event
  3. **ECONOMIC_DAMAGE** (int) : the economic damage  
  4. **BIN_GROUP_PER_EVENT_TYPE** (Ord.factor w/ 2 levels) : 
  a factor that divides the observations for each 
  weather event type to two complementary levels, 
  one with the 90% of observations with the lowest impact and 
  another with the 10% of observations with the highest impact.

and 140236 observations.

### 9.3.3 Summarize the processed data for harm on economy with respect to economic damage by each weather event type {#ind-9-3-3--Summarize-the-processed-data-for-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-economic-damage-by-each-weather-event-type}  

To evaluate the harm on economy by each weather event type 
with respect to economic damage a simplistic approach was adopted :  

  * the weather event types were ranked 
  from the most harmful to the least 
  based on the overall average economic damage 
  of the weather events that resulted in non-zero economic damage

The overall average economic damage caused by each weather event type 
was initially examined along with the skewness of the economic damage 
for each weather event type. In most cases the skewness was high 
(or even extremely high), so it was possible that the overall mean 
misrepresented the consequences of each weather event type.  

That is the reason why the average economic damage for 90% of weather events 
with the lowest impact versus the average economic damage for the 10% of 
weather events with the highest impact were also computed and examined.  

**It is highlighted that for the average economic damage 
that refers to the 10% of the cases that had the highest impact, 
there were few observations available for a lot of weather event types 
and the corresponding mean values should be interpreted with caution.**

```{r create_the_table_with_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_economic_damage_by_each_weather_event_type}

The results of the table with the summary 
for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage
by each weather event type that was created in this section 
were presented at the subsection 
[10.2.4 Most harmful event types with respect to economic damage
](#ind-10-2-4--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-economic-damage)
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS).  

The table with the summary for the harm on economy 
with respect to economic damage by each weather event type 
was exported (as an R file), in the folder of the working directory: 

* *outputs --> harm_on_economy --> results* 
  
with filename:  

* *summary______harm_on_economy______economic_damage.R*
  
```{r exprot_the_summary_for_the_harm_on_economy_with_respect_to_economic_damage}

# Supply the filepath at which the table with the summary
# for the harm on economy will be exported.
filepath_____summary_____harm_on_economy______economic_damage <-

The main reason for exporting the file with the summary 
for the harm on economy with respect to crop damage by each weather event type 
was to supply a checkpoint for any attempts to reproduce the analysis.

### 9.3.4 Visualize the results of the summary for the harm on economy with respect to economic damage by each weather event type {#ind-9-3-4--Visualize-the-results-of-the-summary-for-the-harm-on-economy-with-respect-to-economic-damage-by-each-weather-event-type}  

From the table with the summary for the harm on economy 
by each weather event type with respect to economic damage 
the **Multiplot 2.3** was created to present an overview of the results 
for the three different aspects that were examined for this perspective.  

Four elementary plots were 
[created](#ind-9-3-4-1--Create-the-components-of-Multiplot-2-3):  

* [9.3.4.1.1 Create The Plot 2.3.1](#ind-9-3-4-1-1--Create-The-Plot-2-3-1)  
  * Displays the overall average economic damage 
  caused by each weather event type based 
  on all the cases of weather events 
  that resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
* [9.3.4.1.2 Create The Plot 2.3.2](#ind-9-3-4-1-2--Create-The-Plot-2-3-2)  
  * Displays the average economic damage 
  caused by each weather event type based on 90% of weather events 
  with the lowest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
* [9.3.4.1.3 Create The Plot 2.3.3](#ind-9-3-4-1-3--Create-The-Plot-2-3-3)  
  * Displays the average economic damage 
  caused by each weather event type based on 10% of weather events 
  with the highest impact (for each weather event type) 
  that resulted in non-zero economic damage.  
* [9.3.4.1.4 Create The Plot 2.3.4](#ind-9-3-4-1-4--Create-The-Plot-2-3-4)  
  * Displays a comparison for each weather event type, 
  of the average economic damage for the 90% of its observations 
  with the lowest impact versus the average economic damage 
  for the 10% of its observations with the highest impact 
  based only on the weather events that resulted 
  in non-zero economic damage.  

which were then [combined](#ind-9-3-4-2--Compose-the-Multiplot-2-3) 
in order to obtain the **Multiplot 2.3**.

It constitutes the *PART 2* of the *Figure 2* 
that displays the overview of the harm on economy 
by each weather event type.  

*(Note that neither the Multiplot 2.3 nor the elementary plots that it contains 
were presented in this section due to the restrictions imposed by the assignment 
to include in the report at least 1 but no more than 3 figures. 
It can be examined at the subsection 
[10.2.1 Overview of results for the harm on economy
](#ind-10-2-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-economy) 
of the chapter [10 RESULTS](#ind-10--RESULTS), 
where the Figure 2 was presented, 
of which the Multiplot 2.3 constitutes the PART 3.)

The *Plot 2.3.1* displays 
**the overall average economic damage** 
caused by each weather event type taking into account 
all and only the observation that resulted in non-zero economic damage. 

The weather event types were matched with a number 
that represents the rank which was assigned to each of them 
from the most harmful to the least with respect to economy, 
based on the **overall average economic damage** they caused.  

The skewness of the economic damage

(based on which the overall economic damage was computed) 
had been encoded in the color of the bar associated with each of them.

#### 9.3.4.2 Compose the Multiplot 2.3 {#ind-9-3-4-2--Compose-the-Multiplot-2-3}  

The four elementary plots that were created from 
the results of the summary for the harm on economy 
with respect to economic damage by each weather event type, 
were combined to construct a single multiplot 
that displays the complete picture for this perspective.

# 10 RESULTS {#ind-10--RESULTS}  
***  

The unprocessed raw data from the file 
[repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2
](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)
that contains observations from 
[Storm Events Dataset](#ind-4--STORM-EVENTS-DATASET) 
that was created and made publicly available 
by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
was processed to obtain 
[the table with processed data](#ind-7--PROCESSED-DATA) 
(through a processing pipeline which was described in detail at the chapter 
[6 DATA PROCESSING](#ind-6--DATA-PROCESSING)).

Based on the table with the processed data 
which contains valid observations for weather events 
that happened at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011 
and caused harm either to population health (resulted in fatalities or injuries) 
or to economy (resulted in property or crop damage) 
the results of this analysis were produced 
for the two questions of interest set by the assignment 
(for which the guidelines can be found at the section 
[2.1 About The Assignment](#ind-2-1--About-The-Assignment), 
that were presented in the following sections of this chapter:  

* [10.1 Question 1: Across the United States, 
which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) 
are most harmful with respect to population health?
](#results-harm-on-population-health)

## 10.1 Question 1: Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health? {#ind-10-1--results-harm-on-population-health}  

In an attempt to identify the most harmful weather event types 
with respect to population health three different perspectives were examined 
(for which the analysis can be examined at the chapter 
[8 HARM ON POPULATION HEALTH](#ind-8--HARM-ON-POPULATION-HEALTH)).  

A short overview of the results was presented at the subsection:  

* [10.1.1 Overview of results for the harm on population health
](#ind-10-1-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-population-health)  

Further details, at each of the three perspectives, 
are available at the following subsections:  

* [10.1.2 Most harmful event types with respect to fatalities
  ](#ind-10-1-2--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-fatalities) 
* [10.1.3 Most harmful event types with respect to injuries
  ](#ind-10-1-3--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-injuries) 
* [10.1.4 Most harmful event types with respect to casualties
  ](#ind-10-1-4--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-casualties) 


It is highlighted that the results 
must be evaluated under the following context in order to be meaningful: 

* __The results for any perspective (fatalities, injuries or casualties) 
refer specifically to the harm that was caused 
when harm with respect to that particular perspective was observed.__

(*In other words the results do not refer 
to the harm caused for a perspective of interest 
when a weather phenomenon of an included weather event type occurred 
independently of whether or not it caused harm 
with respect to the perspective that was examined.*)  

In addition, due to the fact that it was decided 
to include only the weather event types 
for which there were available at least 10 observations 
that corresponded to weather events that resulted in non-zero harm 
with respect to each perspective examined, 
the composition of weather event types 
for the three perspectives is different.  

For each perspective, it was consider appropriate to present 
three aspects in order to supply an insightful picture of the 
consequences caused by each weather event type: 

* the overall average harm  
* the average harm of 90% of cases with lower impact  
* the average harm of 10% of cases with higher impact  

The number of observations as well as their skewness 
were summarized by each weather event types for every aspect 
and presented along with the corresponding average. 

Although the overall average harm was used as the primary criterion 
to determine the most harmful events, it should be examined along with the 
average harm for the two other subgroups, especially when the overall skewness 
for a weather event type of interest is high.

### 10.1.2 Most harmful event types with respect to fatalities {#ind-10-1-2--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-fatalities}  

According to the summary for the harm on population health 
with respect to fatalities by each weather event type 
(that were obtained at the section 
[8.1 Harm On Population Health With Respect To Fatalities By Each Weather Event Type
](#ind-8-1--Harm-On-Population-Health-With-Respect-To-Fatalities-By-Each-Weather-Event-Type)) 
out of the 26 included weather event types 
(for each of which at least 10 observations 
that resulted in non-zero fatalities 
at United States in the period from 2001 to 2011 were available) 
there were 7 of them that stand out:  

  1. When a weather event of type **TORNADO** resulted in fatalities, 
  it caused about 3.4 fatalities on average 
  (based on 339 observations 
  that had extreme positive skewness equal to 13.5732). 
  For 9 out of 10 times of such cases, 
  an average of 1.88 fatalities was observed 
  (based on the 90% of cases with the lower impact 
  for which 305 observations were available, 
  that had moderate positive skewness equal to 1.812), 
  while for the remaining 1 out of 10 times 
  it caused around 17 fatalities on average 
  (based on the 10% of cases with the higher impact 
  for which 34 observations were available, 
  that had high positive skewness equal to 4.9099).   
  2. When a weather event of type **DEBRIS FLOW** resulted in fatalities, 
  it caused about 3.36 fatalities on average 
  (based on 11 observations 
  that had moderate positive skewness equal to 1.6608). 
  For 9 out of 10 times of such cases, 
  an average of 1.44 fatalities was observed 
  (based on the 90% of cases with the lower impact 
  for which only 9 observations were available, 
  that had moderate positive skewness equal to 2.0673), 
  while for the remaining 1 out of 10 times 
  it caused around 12 fatalities on average 
  (based on the 10% of cases with the higher impact 
  for which only 2 observations were available, 
  that had low positive skewness equal to 0).  
  3. When a weather event of type **HURRICANE/TYPHOON** resulted in fatalities, 
  it caused about 2.96 fatalities on average 
  (based on 23 observations 
  that had moderate positive skewness equal to 2.1981). 
  For 9 out of 10 times of such cases, 
  an average of 1.95 fatalities was observed 
  (based on the 90% of cases with the lower impact 
  for which 20 observations were available,

## 10.2 Question 2 : Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences? {#ind-10-2--results-harm-on-economy}  

In an attempt to identify the most harmful weather event types 
with respect to economy three different perspectives were examined 
(for which the analysis can be examined at the chapter 
[9 HARM ON ECONOMY](#ind-9--HARM-ON-ECONOMY).  

A short overview of the results was presented at the subsection:  

* [10.2.1 Overview of results for the harm on economy
](#ind-10-2-1--Overview-of-results-for-the-harm-on-economy)  

Further details, at each of the three perspectives, 
are available at the following subsections:  

* [10.2.2 Most harmful event types with respect to property damage
  ](#ind-10-2-2--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-property-damage)  
* [10.2.3 Most harmful event types with respect to crop damage
  ](#ind-10-2-3--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-crop-damage)  
* [10.2.4 Most harmful event types with respect to economic damage
  ](#ind-10-2-4--Most-harmful-weather-event-types-with-respect-to-economic-damage)  
 
It is highlighted that the results 
must be evaluated under the following context in order to be meaningful: 

* __The results for a perspective 
(property damage, crop damage or economic damage) 
refer specifically to the harm that was caused 
when harm with respect to that perspective was observed.__

(*In other words the results do not refer 
to the harm caused for a perspective of interest 
when a weather phenomenon of an included weather event type occurred 
independently of whether or not it caused harm 
with respect to the perspective that was examined.*)  

In addition, due to the fact that it was decided 
to include only the weather event types 
for which there were available at least 10 observations 
that corresponded to weather events that resulted in non-zero harm 
with respect to each perspective examined, 
the composition of weather event types 
for the three perspectives is different.  

For each perspective, it was consider appropriate to present 
three aspects in order to supply an insightful picture of the 
consequences caused by each weather event type: 

* the overall average harm  
* the average harm of 90% of cases with lower impact  
* the average harm of 10% of cases with higher impact  

The number of observations as well as their skewness 
were summarized by each weather event types for every aspect 
and presented along with the corresponding average. 

Although the overall average harm was used as the primary criterion 
to determine the most harmful events, it should be examined along with the 
average harm for the two other subgroups, especially when the overall skewness 
for a weather event type of interest is high.

<br>  

## 11.1 Session Info {#ind-11-1--Session-Info}  

The details with respect to the operating system, 
R version as wells as the versions of the libraries 
used to create this report are supplied 
to help in any attempt to reproduce the report.  

```{r capture_and_diplay_the_session_info}

# Captures the session info.

## 11.3 MD5 Checksums {#ind-11-3--MD5-Checksums}  

To easily verify the integrity and validity of some important files 
that were either imported or exported through the execution of the script 
that produces the report with the analysis their MD5 checksums were computed 
and exported as txt files with the help of a utility function 
that was created and used, [export_md5sums()
](#ind-11-3-1--Create-a-utility-function-to-export-MD5-checksums).  

Three txt files with MD5 checksums were created:  
  
  1. [unprocessed_data_____MD5_checksum.txt
  ](#ind-11-3-2--MD5-checksum-of-the-input-file-with-the-unprocessed-data)  
  2. [processed_data_____MD5_checksum.txt
  ](#ind-11-3-3--MD5-checksum-for-the-output-file-with-the-processed-data)  
  3. [results_____MD5_checksum.txt
  ](#ind-11-3-4--MD5-checksum-of-the-output-files-with-the-results) 

and exported at the subdirectory of the working directory: 

* *output --> reproducibility_support --> MD5_checksums* 

The [original files with the MD5 Checksums
](https://github.com/jzstats/Reproducible-Research--2nd-Assignment/tree/master/outputs/reproducibility_support/MD5_checksums) 
have been uploaded to github.

### 11.3.1 Create a utility function to export MD5 checksums {#ind-11-3-1--Create-a-utility-function-to-export-MD5-checksums}  

To create txt files with the MD5 checksums 
the utility function *export_md5sums()* was created and used.

It takes as input two arguments:  

  1. target_files
     * the paths to the files of which we want to compute the MD5 checksums  
  2. output_file 
     * the path at which the txt file with the MD5 checksums of the 
     target files will be exported 
     
Upon execution, 
it creates a txt file at the path denoted by the argument 'output_file' 
in which it stores the MD5 checksums of the files found at the paths supplied 
via the 'target_files' argument.  

The txt files consists of one row for each of the target files, which:

### 11.3.4 MD5 checksum of the output files with the results {#ind-11-3-4--MD5-checksum-of-the-output-files-with-the-results}  

The results obtained in this analysis consist of 6 summary tables. 

Those that correspond to the results for the harm on population health 
(over each of the three perspectives examined)
which were exported as R files through the execution of the script, with names: 

  1. summary_____harm_on_population_health______fatalities.R

And those that correspond to the results for the harm on economy
(over each of the three perspectives examined) 
which were exported as R files through the execution of the script, with names: 

  1. summary_____harm_on_economy______property_damage.R

A txt file with the MD5 checksum of all 6 output R files described above, 
was exported at the subdirectory of the working directory:  

* *output --> reproducibility_support --> MD5_checksums* 

with name:  

* *resulsts_____MD5_checksum.txt*  

```{r export_a_txt_file_with_the_MD5_checksums_of_the_exported_tables_with_the_results}

# Supply the filepath at which the txt file with MD5 checksums

## 11.4 Random Seed {#ind-11-4--Random-Seed}  

At the beginning of the analysis a random seed was selected 
equal to **1234567890** to enhance the reproducibility of the report.

If the procedure have been reproduced correctly,
(with respect to random events) at this point it is expected 
to produce a sample from standard normal distribution 
with the following 5 values :  

* -2.2152999  
* 0.4738228 
* -0.4869480 
* -0.5343663  
* 1.3206245

```{r produce_random_normal_values_for_control}

# Creates 5 random values out of typical normal distributions 
# to check the reproducibility of random events.  
expected_values_of_final_random_event <- rnorm(5)

# Display the 5 random values. 
expected_values_of_final_random_event

```

However, keep in mind that the only random events that took place 
through the execution of the script that produces this report 
happened at the creation of the plots:  
  
  1. [Plot 1.1.4](#Create-The-Plot-1-1-4)  
  2. [Plot 1.2.4](#Create-The-Plot-1-2-4)  
  3. [Plot 1.3.4](#Create-The-Plot-1-3-4)  
  4. [Plot 2.1.4](#Create-The-Plot-2-1-4)  
  5. [Plot 2.2.4](#Create-The-Plot-2-2-4)  
  6. [Plot 2.3.4](#Create-The-Plot-2-3-4)  

by the function *geom_repel_label()* in order to assign randomly 
the positions of the labels. 

So even if the random seed is not the same 
only the labels in those plots should be in different places, 
while the actual results are expected to be the identical.
